Trading Notes

* ENTRY - <2014-06-15 Sun 12:05> - Fro many time points on a chart, could be right in either direction, but want to lose less than you win if you're wrong.

* FINISHED - <2014-06-15 Sun 12:04>- <2014-05-22 Thu 19:50> - /share/sql/tt getting 2 entries in Futures contracts, need to check them. - Were 2 entries, must have changed or wrong info from IB?

* ENTRY - <2014-04-23 Wed 18:28> - Studying Electricity brings to mind many factors of trading. :Electric:
*** ENTRY - <2014-04-23 Wed 18:29> - Magnetic resonance - technically used in medical imaging, but thought provoking
*** ENTRY - <2014-04-23 Wed 18:29> - The presence of waves of all different varieties on every plane of sensory experience. Of course, how this relates to charts and their reading, which is what my trading is all about.
*** ENTRY - <2014-04-23 Wed 18:39> - Standing waves, recognizing, disintegrating
*** ENTRY - <2014-04-23 Wed 18:40> - Antenna - radiation resistance
*** ENTRY - <2014-04-23 Wed 18:41> - Power sources and power dissipation
*** ENTRY - <2014-04-23 Wed 18:43> - electromagnetic induction - sort of like resonating with what is near you

* ENTRY - <2014-03-28 Fri 09:17> - Since leaving Dallas, and a bit before that, looking at this again. Instructions below,
* HOWTO - <2012-08-28 Tue 16:21> - How to run ptsupdater - to bring data for various underlyings", show that 12/13/13 was latest update. I'm relying on Emacs to provide the interface to  the Postgresql database, looking at .emacs, the pgsql db is "trading" and the password and user both are "trader1". grep in /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptscharts/src/main/java/ptscharts shows trader1 in /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptscharts/src/main/java/ptscharts/PtsOrderTable1Row.java. More significantly, in /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptsutils/src/main/java/ptsutils/PtsDBops.java. Check the Emacs commands in /share/elisp/ptsprogs.el. Running M-x ptscharts starts maven/groovy and load file /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptscharts/ptschartsdriver.groovy which is the control of the charts. More instructions in there.

* ENTRY - <2013-11-30 Sat 11:48> - Back to my own pts programs. Java and Groovy, JFreechart, Netbeans - looking at the utils/stats class in netbeans. /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptsutils/src/main/java/ptsutils/Stats.java

* ABOUT - <2013-11-08 Fri 13:28> - Trading has bugged me in a most peculiar way for the longest time. Is it all about this idea of some sort of outcome? What is it? Why does it keep bugging? 

* CHECK - <2013-10-13 Sun 09:20> - How long do you want to wait for it to hit a certain price. 2 parameters. price and time.

* HOWTO - <2013-10-11 Fri 15:32> - start latest tws https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=556

* ABOUT - <2013-10-10 Thu 12:53> - Checking out options using TOS on the desktop via rdesktop - execute /share/scripts/remote2desktop. Thought is to use it for charts (Prohpet etc.), some analysis and TWS for trading. Said this same on 5/18/13.
*** ABOUT - <2013-10-10 Thu 13:05> - Prophet charting of option, it gives a comparison to the underlying. Can tell when how the underlying and option synch,
***** You can detach numerous chart windows, and other windows, so actually have a whole bunch of windows open at the same time.

* FINISHED - <2014-06-15 Sun 12:08>- <2013-09-23 Mon 18:26> - Update the futures contracts in Quotes1Min - /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptsupdater/09232013.csv - 

* CANCELED - <2013-06-16 Sun 09:22> - Opening account at TradeKing - rickcharon 4Te2Play, also signed up for OptionApps at http://www.optionapps.com, which is web based, and Asio Options Wine app. passwords are usaually 4Te2Learn or similar

* UPDATE - <2013-05-18 Sat 12:01> - Right now, I want to use TOS for analysis and tws to trade. Tos is charging ticket price, so are way more expensive, but ib doesn't have very good tools.


* CHECK - <2013-05-16 Thu 14:59> - "At extreme levels of market sentiment the market tends to be most predictable, the best precondition for taking a trade. see /share/EBooks/Trading/Trading Against the Crowd.pdf

* CHECK - <2013-04-29 Mon 09:47> - Mkts have a optimistic bias, so the pessimism falls fast.

* TODO - <2013-04-17 Wed 08:17> - Map out the creation and realization of a trading idea -
*** Develop org-agenda-keywords
***** IN-PROGRESS - <2013-05-21 Tue 11:57> - I'm looking at conversion/reversals and other ideas from Cottle's book, /share/EBooks/Trading/CharlesCottle-OptionsTrading-TheHiddenReality.pdf - so this isn't so much a trading idea as a screen to look for certain setups - call it  *SETUP* or *CONDITION* or what?
*** <2013-05-16 Thu 16:47> Contrary technicals - CBOE Equity Only Put/Call ratio?
***** http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:put_call_ratio

* CHECK - <2013-04-17 Wed 06:35> - Oil prices are going down because of false reports of possible reserves from fracking, this will lead to deep dip, followed by meteoric rise in oil futures at some future date. The stage is being set.

* ABOUT - <2013-04-11 Thu 16:20> - New concept for options - use the web and everything else - place a trade when ready
*** CHECK - <2013-04-11 Thu 16:56> - http://www.cboe.com/TradTool/tb/TradeBuilderFramed.aspx - build trades using options and underlying and shows their potential

* UPDATE - <2013-04-04 Thu 12:31> - Taking some time to look at IB re options again
*** <2013-04-07 Sun 08:35> very irritating interface, and help desk at IB is lacking.

* IN-PROGRESS - <2012-09-20 Thu 11:14> - Downloading data to date using ptsupdater

* TODO - <2012-08-28 Tue 16:27> - Find a way to do stats on data, using the compressed datasets and hopefully some sort of souped up array class in Java or Groovy :stats:
*** See StatUtils class in org.apache.commons.math - local Maven repo is ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/commons/commons-math/2.0/
*** TODO - <2012-08-29 Wed 11:59> get daily ranges for each symbol
***** Need to get the price array as simple double[], compute range for each day, find min, max, and mode for that range -
***** Imagine most of the time to create a PtsChart is getting the data setup, so using that to get at arrays of price data
***** Daily range is highest high minus lowest low for day. (see /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptscharts/ptschartsdriver.groovy for work).
***** IN-PROGRESS - <2012-09-01 Sat 11:49> - Set up a Stats class in PtsUtils, and :stats:
***** IN-PROGRESS - <2012-09-01 Sat 18:33> - class HiLoRangeStats -
***** IN-PROGRESS - <2012-09-02 Sun 18:56> - Printed out values in /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptscharts/hilos.csv

* HOWTO - <2012-08-28 Tue 16:21> - How to run ptsupdater - to bring data for various underlyings - 
1. Create a file for the updater, see for instructions
   1. Run sql commands found in /share/sql/setupFuturesUpdates.sql
2. Start up the "IB Gateway" through java webstart is easiest, current command line would  be "javaws /share/IB/ibg.jnlp", Paper Trading rchar489 te2learn, Real Trading rchar671 Te2Trade
3. Run the ptsupdater, e.g., - "java -jar /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptsupdater/target/ptsupdater-1.5-SNAPSHOT.jar <file.csv>" (easiest is M-x ptsupdater in Emacs).
   
* HOWTO - <2012-08-28 Tue 16:25> - Run ptscharts - easiest is from emacs, M-x ptscharts, this brings up a groovy window and /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptscharts/ptschartsdriver.groovy which has code to C-c C-r to Groovy.
   

* IN-PROGRESS - <2012-08-22 Wed 18:40> - Jumping back in, easy to find path back because still using Emacs and ptscharts command. Still some more to do to get back to where I was with Groovy, Maven, and the ideas below on the todos.

* NOTES - <2012-03-02 Fri 15:12> - Back after a long hyatus, 

* TODO - <2012-08-24 Fri 11:53> <2011-11-23 Wed 15:47> - Develop the 6-pointed evaluation of possible price movement, all in numbers,
The idea is to have a series of evaluators, or indicators, and fuse them together to arrive at 1 number, probability of move up or down. The move has to be significant enough.
*** <2011-11-28 Mon 14:14> - at the bottom of /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptscharts/ptschartsdriver.groovy started exploratory code, the code there gets all the ohlcv data, now need to get at the indicator values, looks like class IndicatorGroup could contain all or most of code, added set and getname() to indicator, see IndicatorSet1, 
***** NOTES - <2011-11-28 Mon 16:37> - Changed /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptscharts/pom.xml dependency for ptsutils to specific SNAPSHOT version,
*** <2011-11-23 Wed 15:47> Looking at /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptscharts/src/main/java/ptscharts/indicators/IndicatorSet1.java, If I can just gather the numbers the indicators are putting out, and operate on those, that's part of what I want. It might be easiest to leave the code as it is, i.e., there is still a chart with indicators being created, but pull the numbers out rather than displaying the chart. the idea would be to start with getting a print out of the open, high, low, close, volume, indicator1, ..., indicator-n, datetime, for any particular datetime, or set of datetimes.

* ABOUT - <2011-11-24 Thu 13:35> - Trading as seva? -
*** It doesn't seem like it can be not selfish? How?


* HOWTO - <2011-11-23 Wed 13:55> - Run the charts from inside of Emacs -
*** Start the program ptscharts, lives in /share/elisp/ptsprogs.el. This starts a Maven shell with Groovy running, and puts you in a buffer for file /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptscharts/ptschartsdriver.groovy, which has code that can be run interactively in the Maven groovy shell, using C-c C-r for eval region, etc

* HOWTO - <2011-11-23 Wed 13:41> - Update the symbols so that the PtsUpdater gets the right Expiries, expiry has to be after or equal to current date for it to work: (all sql is for the Postgresql DB - trading)
*** In the file /share/sql/pgQuotes1minmisc.sql is this code to list out the maxexpiries currently in the db:
SELECT symbol, max(expiry) as maxexpiry FROM quotes1min group by symbol order by maxexpiry;
*** In the file /share/sql/pgFutureContractDetails.sql is code to get the needed expires, like this:
SELECT distinct symbol, expiry, exchange FROM futuresContractDetails where symbol in ('ZS', 'CL') and
    expiry >= 20111128 and expiry <= 20120300 order by symbol, expiry;
*** Using info from these commands, create a csv file in /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptsupdater/, here is a typical file:
CL, 20120120, NYMEX, 2011-11-15 00:00, 2011-11-23 14:00
ZS, 20120113, ECBOT, 2011-10-26 00:00, 2011-11-23 14:00
*** Run the ptsupdater, in Emacs it lives in /share/elisp/ptsprogs.el, Java command:
java -jar /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptsupdater/target/ptsupdater-1.4.jar <csv file>
*** Run the above without the csv file as arg to update all symbols

* NOTES - <2011-06-01 Wed 13:39> - Moved the observations on different symbols to /share/TeAmigo/teamigo.github.com/trading/observations.org

* NOTES - <2011-04-18 Mon 13:01> - Dollar and JPY are both up and everything else is down? What does
  this mean?

* <2010-11-08 Mon 08:03> rpc - Given the rotten state of the mkts, the corruption and
  general disarray of reason, do I want to participate?,

* Mon Jul 12 06:35:27 2010 rpc - So, given the rotten state of the order placement in TWS,
  going to develop my own simple order window, note that the UpdateAll is working nicely now,
  there are 2 files currently in /share/PeTraSys/, they control the Updaters situation, killing it if
  it goes into the void, and determining if it should be continuous, modifying these at runtime
  give control over the program,

* Tue Jul  6 05:01:07 2010 rpc - So, I launched the paper trading platform to check out
  the order ticket windows, and it went into the 100% cpu melt down when I selected buy from a
  chart window, what a piece of shit!, Here go some test trades, to get the feel of
  order settings, etc., 0.8461 * .95 = 

  BOT	1	AUD	SEP10 Futures 	0.8461	USD	GLOBEX	05:47:19		2.46		20100913	
  SLD	1	AUD	SEP10 Futures 	0.8469	USD	GLOBEX	08:07:12		2.46	75.08	20100913	
  BOT	1	EUR	SEP10 Futures 	1.2661	USD	GLOBEX	09:23:39		2.46		20100913	
  SLD	1	EUR	SEP10 Futures 	1.2634	USD	GLOBEX	10:46:44		2.46	-342.42	20100913
  In fairness to myself, this last trade was checking the trading mechanism more than a
  trade I would have made, needed to confirm that set up OCA group behaves as advertised, and it does,
  so give a stop your own OCA name, like the Underlying symbol, and them put any new stops, profit
  targets, etc. in that same group, that way, you can create a trade with just a stop, and add another
  kind of stop, or profit target later, very handy,


  CAD is looking like an up play,  but needs some push to get started,
  EUR is a turn around possiblility,
  
* Thu Jul  1 15:20:23 2010 rpc -
  EUR ran 4k up since yesterday,
  

* Wed Jun 30 07:05:24 2010 rpc - I've had to kill and restart TWS 2x today already,
  reliability of the platform is an issue,
  EUR - Watching for a breakout above 1.2299 or below 1.2240
        07:49 - at 7:17 it bounced against 1.2299, but didn't penetrate and fell back,
        now down to 1.2252!
** NOTE:  IB alerts don't seem to work at all, so making an alert app might be good, Has
   been terrible today!, had to shut it down 3x, now am trying the standalone, see if it works
   any better,

* Tue Jun 29 04:59:08 2010 rpc - A certain nagging sense that I need to,
  "wash your hands",
  ZN 05:40 - Waiting for it to turn up? 06:09 - seems stalled
  AUD 06:17 - Been sucking down pretty bad, but think it's due to turn up,
  16:30 - EUR and DX are diametrically apposed, amazing, see /share/Snapshots/Eur-Dx.png
  

* Wed Jun 23 05:43:46 2010 rpc - The question of Sankalpa,
  my deepest and truest Intention, this comes to mind,

* Mon Jun 21 05:11:50 2010 rpc - I need more emphasis
  on managing the trade, entering the trade is good enough for now, managing it's lifetime
  is the goal for now, focus is on currency futures for now,
  AUD - was  so right Friday, would be a 2k profit this morning!, my thoughts about rates
  seems to be right, all are down
  EUR - 05:54 - Long, @06/23/2010 05:49 - wrong way for this distance, but worked for very short trade,

* Fri Jun 18 11:28:16 2010 rpc - Pulled out of the AUD position
  with a $700 profit, that felt good, go by what feels the best, at any
  particular moment, go for what feels best on the deepest level, a question,
  is it better to pretty much stay away from the energies?, they are SO volatile,
  currencies have more of a tendency to trend, going to look at Globex, see what sort of
  books have been written about it,

  A bunch of pattern videos,

* Wed Jun 16 13:42:45 2010 rpc - Entered a pos for AUD, pretty quick, sort of "from the ParaVac"
  see ooffice -calc /share/databases/ProfitLossCalcs.ods (via Trading menu)

* Tue Jun 15 04:59:07 2010 rpc - I believe
  both AUD and CL are long term up, and Treasuries are long term down, 

* Mon Jun  7 09:59:18 2010 rpc -
  AUD - see /share/Snapshots/Screenshot-AUD.USD Forex-60min 03-11-09 12:00 - 06-07-10 08:00.png
        seems directionless, 14:07 - dropped 700
  CAD - climbing today, convinced? dropped 600 predicted in drawing, see
        /share/Snapshots/Screenshot-CAD.USD Forex-7min 05-31-10 12:00 - 06-07-10 09:14.png
  CL - Gimping up everything, check Snapshots,

* Sun Jun  6 15:13:11 2010 rpc - This morning, early, had the following intuitions,
  ES - generally weak, look for down over the week, definitely weak on chart!! so down though,
       might want to wait for pullback
  CL - will be strong, but lots of mucky muck, because of general economic weakness,
       (looks weak on chart!), very conflicted mkt
  GBP - probably has a little bit more dropping to do,
  ZN - pushing up, such a pert chart!,

* Fri Jun  4 13:23:03 2010 rpc - Gave back most of what I made,
  so, not so hot today...

* Thu Jun  3 05:00:10 2010 rpc - As I look back over trades, some obvious things to watch,
  1 - The big CL loss had a profit goal smaller than stop, probably shouldn't do that!,
  2 - Since my win rate os about 47%, better make sure the profit is significantly above stop,

* Sat May 29 13:58:40 2010 rpc - Created a Trades table in Trading db (MySql)
  see db Trading table Trades in MySql on localhost,

  AUD - looks down trend on month hr chart,
  ZN - definitely trying to climb over last couple of weeks, but now succumbing to downward pressure,
       big jump up coming into today, then down, 07:25 - predict down
  ZF - 5yr Treasury, looks the same but less pronounced, need to get this one in db,
  ZB - 30yr, same, big mountain peak today, up, then down
  DX - got weak in the knees today, interesting that it falls and rates rise, knee jerk like,
       which currency is strong?
  GBP - up like a rocket, as DX goes down and Treasuries go down (i.e., rates up!;-),

* Tue May 25 07:45:42 2010 rpc - I am probably going to use this notes file in the future,
  right now, the file /share/databases/ProfitLossCalcs.ods an OO Spreadsheet, is being used,
** The /share/databases/ProfitLossCalcs.ods file is for recording trades, which are saved to db
   (see May 29th entry here), this file is still good for notes, also, not putting date in if just checking,
   not entering yet,

* Sun May 16 13:47:32 2010 rpc - A recap of last week
  9 trades, 6 wins, 3 losses, .667, losses generally smaller than wins, with Cl exception,
  

* Sat May 15 11:11:11 2010 rpc - Have created 	/share/notes/notes-tradingutils
  Which has notes about the tools in Emacs that are useful here, like calc, and
  using sql, also has list of Price/Magnifiers printed out to do calcs,

* Fri May 14 08:14:04 2010 rpc -
  DX - close out at 86.22 (86.22 - 85) * 1000 = 1220 WIN
  ES - close out at 1133 (1154.50 - 1133) * 50 = 1075 WIN
  ZN - close out at 119'285 ((119 + (28.5 / 32)) - ((119 + (2.5/32)))) * 1000 = [812.5] WIN
  NG - did bleed down a little, from about 4.36 at 10 yesterday to 428 now, (4.36 - 4.28) * 10000 = [800.]
       but didn't enter,

  P/L = 1220 + 1075 + 812.5 = [3107.5]

  P/L for week = 3107.5 -2420 + 890.4 + 2630 = [4207.9]

* Thu May 13 09:06:16 2010 rpc -
  ES, ZN, DX still all range bound 
  DX, 09:10 - could take 300 profit right now, 16:45 - Moving stop up to 85.48
  ES, 09:15 - 500+ loss if closed now, at 1165.25: 16:49 - back down to 1155.5
  ZN, 09:17 - 118'285 ((118 + (28.5/32)) - (119 + (2.5/32))) * 1000 = -187.5
      16:51 - 119'050, slight profit
  CL, 09:21 - close out (76.92 - 74.5) * 1000 = -2420 LOSS
  NG dripping red paint ~10:00, looks like a definite down play, 16:09, wait for morning

  P/L 
  -2420
  
  HIT STOP, out with big loss on CL! now its climbing again, this future is totally manipulated.
  all the energies are, stay with rates, stock market and currencies, manipulated, but in much bigger ways,
  so easier to move into and out off easily, is this right? All of them are manipulated,
  My stops may need to be tighter on ES, 

  I need to check my stop amounts, and consider that when considering a position, a too big stop, if
  required, negates the position,  
  

* Wed May 12 09:44:05 2010 rpc -

* Tue May 11 08:38:51 2010 rpc - I still seem to be honing my method down,
  Is this true? - Yes,
  I'm using the calc-grab-region command in emacs to do the calcs for P/L, see yesterday,
  bonding it to C-M-g, C-M-c is boind to the clipboard viewer,

c  CL - still long from yesterday,

       CL, ES, ZN still open

* Mon May 10 04:29:07 2010 rpc - What I am looking for is a permanent skill, 
  an ability to, "read charts", so that I can consistently and always trade successfully,
  not that I would mind a good trade or two on the way to that ultimate success!,
  rr - I envisioned this triangle, like a drawing triangle, that had its fulcrum at a price point,
       and then would swing to indicate price action,

  cc      make tools that can be spun and moved on a chart, like the triangle mentioned above,
  cc is for chart suggestions

* Fri May  7 05:56:32 2010 rpc - Going through this file and marking research  with "rr"s
  Spend some time really thinking about the charts, let them penetrate, let them work inside
  you, The lines and entry with both exits are nice, I'll keep them, but, need to adjust, and
  perhaps save as a new chart?, that way, can keep a history of sorts, How much up/down price
  movement does a certain volume cause says something about presence of buyers/sellers?, So what I'm seeing
  (DX), is ride ranges, wait for 3 bar breakout, bet that direction, use trailing stop adjusted
  to ~3bar back close, stay in the bet over time, Don't think there is as much opportunity for
  any but huge player and govt interference in these markets, of course, the banks could...

  10:26 - Been at this a while today, and doing the forward scroll, to develop predicting power,
          and notice this starting to get strange premonitions, like dumping ladles, big molten metal
          pouring (CAD), reigned horse rearing up, and of course the dragons, but they don't seem to have
          directional validity, except the horse may have been whoa, because it stayed range bound after
          that, and the pouring cauldron was slow to come,
  11:28 - AUD is very trendy, but definitely has traps,          

* Thu May  6 16:01:05 2010 rpc -
  I have decided to make 5 positions every day, and monitor that, this will give me a baseline rr
  to determine when I'm ready, (?)
  My idea is to set a stop and profit, enter, monitor, 5 a day,

* Wed May  5 05:03:09 2010 rpc -
  Q:- There was an insight about a probability cloud at the future, and using that to set rr
      stops, profit target, etc. It could be reevaluated at each bar, and a decision made about
      what to do, hold, sell, buy, also, it seems my general sense of the charts is pretty vague,
      how should I proceed?
  W:- In the past, this method arose, so following my promptings, first, start IB, look at some
      charts, I'm watching HO, but the moves are too big for my comfort zone, saved a CL chart
      with my long stop, target marked, see how that does, so the $ is strong, but rates are falling,
      and the prices of energy are falling the last makes sense, the first is puzzling, a strong $
      means things cost less, low rates mean borrowing is easier, or should mean that, again, no clear
      signals,
  E~R:- Proceed very slowly

* Tue May  4 11:09:14 2010 rpc -
  Q:- It looks like HO is going up, it has really wacked down, but too early to tell?
  W:- the big down move is not impressive on a 4hr chart, still within upward general longterm
      move,
  E~R:- Better wait, see what happens tomorrow

* Mon May  3 05:17:17 2010 rpc -
  Looking back to Apr 27, CL is at 86.28, which is way above the target set then,
  Q:- Do I need to think in longer time frames? Also, my focus seems to be very much on Energy,
      CL, HO, and NG, is this appropriate?
  W:- The draw down from 4/27 would have been to 81.29 on 4/28, assuming an entry at 82.60,
      would have watched a 1310 loss on one contract, current exit would give 3680 profit, so
      pretty cool, that definitely suggests long term looking, no contract now, I'm downloading data
      for DX, because it's relevant to all other symbols, the dollar rules when you're trading in dollars,
      the CL move described here suggests deep stops, ouch, NG, which I had going down, is way lower now,
      if it had been entered at 4.352 and exited at 3.921, current, 4310 profit, with 4.424 as highest
      since then, 720 biggest drawdown, so, there you have it!, HO is in an upward trajectory, but right
      now is at new high, so shy,
  E~R:- You're striking out, that's good, search for signals tomorrow, today, rest, do your software,
        recuperate from stress, 
    

* Thu Apr 29 06:51:25 2010 rpc -
  Q:- Still don't have any clear signals, is something wrong with my approach?
  W:- What about my underlying attitude? is it negative? is it getting in the way?
      something seems wrong here, no signals? why? am I going down a totally wrong path?
      Maybe I need to readjust my thinking somehow, I'm not sure I even want to trade, it may be
      too corrupt, too riddled with vileness, isn't there something more noble for me to do
      and provide for us? This is what I need, a noble right livelihood, front running is par for the course
      for GS, JPM, all these other huge firms
  E~R:- You must accept the Guru's goodness and guidance, you have made a commitment to learn to trade,
        so you need to do it, learn to trade,

	Q:- What should I trade today?
  W:- NG is on my mind, it fell like a rock today! the charts for different expirations on IB
      are very screwed up, as a mater of fact, IB is very screwed up, I'm not feeling good about them,
      my charts seem to give more info from the -DX in this case, was a good hint about where it was
      going - DOWN - I need to make 2 params for ADX, for the DXs and for the ADX seperate, and of course
      my chart hairs, NG looks too down to trade now, the move is maybe exhausted, HO is up over all,
      and could bip up over next couple of weeks, ZW seems down long term, up short term,   Things do
      generally drop faster than they rise, looking at NKD, now I'm going to work on my charts, feeling
      thats the next step,
  E~R:- Carry on,

  Q:- How can I come into the greatest harmony with my Dharma?
  W:- That which presents itself unbidden is Dharma, that which comes from God, not the ego,
      it always feels right to act a certain way, the rightest way would be dharma, allow myself
      to feel a constant Presence, don't let myself slip into negative feelings,
  E~R:- It is always simple and deep, it is in the space of knowing,

* Wed Apr 28 10:42:11 2010 rpc -
      Q:- What if anything should I trade today"
      W:- ZC is up but volume as always is small, need to look at the long term charts for everything,
          I feel like I thrash around a lot,   

* Tue Apr 27 05:04:28 2010 rpc - Mindfulness is essential, 	
  I am starting to apply the 5 part contemplation technique to this futures trading,
  here is the idea, POWER is the word, Prepare - become still and centered,
  Optimize, carefully state the question, Write, brain storm, charts, indicators, intuitions, etc.,
  Engage with the Guru, humbly ask for guidance and insight into the issue, Record your results,

  Q: - CL - is it tradable today, and if so, which way?
  10:03 - pretty big red bip today, hills and valleys, hills and valleys, it definitely is not tending
  on hr chart, 5min is down, with big dip at end, maybe exhausted drop, back up last 45min or so,
  still climbing, seem to remember something about excess stores, 4hr trend has been up since may09,
  ER - It's probably up, 83 is target, curently 82.60,
     12:10 - 82.94 was high, now at 82.15,

  NG - 10:26 - More up and down, up and down, slashing around 4k range last couple of weeks 4h chart,
     coming into summer, decreased demand? it just seems like it's all over the place,
  ER - 10:55 - 4.352, target 4.278
     12:12 - low since, 4.21, currently 4.226
  
* Mon Apr 26 06:59:25 2010 rpc - Looking at Wilder's ReactionTrendSystem,
  seems like it might be a good second addition to the screening program, when things are low
  on the DX system, they can be effectively watched with the RTS,

* Mon Apr 19 06:22:49 2010 rpc - Lots of flakiness on the network connection front,
  
* Thu Apr 15 10:35:39 2010 rpc -
  NG - is down tday, about 2k profit if I'd taken it short,
  If I had entered as soon as I saw the trade, 04-14 06:12:15 (see snapshot),
  would have had a 1300 drawdown before ~1500 profit if exited today, but if
  had gone in at 7:30 this morning when it looked down, could have made ~690
  no drawdown! How cool is that?, how can I do this sort of trade?
  Looking at NG now
  11:32 - NG is at lowest it's been in 30 yrs!, WOW!
  CL on the other hand is down around 4 yr prices, pretty much double what it was 30 yrs ago,
  ZC had some real highs in 2008, but has been in 450-200 range for 40yrs otherwise,
  HO had big spikes in 2008, but is still higher than 6 yrs ago,

* Wed Apr 14 06:16:08 2010 rpc - I believe
  NG is going to travel down a dime or so,should I go in? It moves so much,
     better start with something milder,
     16:13 - Didn't do it, went up and sideways

* Tue Apr 13 04:28:53 2010 rpc - Check 40 and 19 IB codes,
  one is not correct,
  CL 04:30 - Downtrend is right!, fallen 2k last 2 days,
     04:53 - Sure looks like its going to fall off,
     05:44 - Sell with stop at 84.85 current is 84.73, at 6:38 hit 84.30,
     09:03 - Low of 83.75@7:20, back up t0 84:44 now,                       

* Mon Apr 12 11:57:01 2010 rpc - So, how do I enter, and once entered, how do I exit?,
  these are the questions we are working on today, 

* Sun Apr 11 17:14:17 2010 rpc -
  CL - may hit 87 this week, watch downtrend,
  GBP 17:24 - looks like definite up possibilities, watch it doesn't fall thru line,
  JPY 18:31 - Up on a 5-wave? prev down was 3-wave?,

* Fri Apr  9 10:14:18 2010 rpc -
  CL - 84 was my mental down, and today was justified, took all week!, 87 was high
       over week

* Thu Apr  8 07:21:14 2010 rpc -
   ZS 07:20 - It shot up yesterday, general feeling it will today as well,
   07:54 - Falling, glad I didn't get in!, no confirmation from trading signals,

* Wed Apr  7 05:54:01 2010 rpc - Looks like the CL push up is winding down,
  06:04 - ZW BB's are pinch-open, pinch-open, right now pinched, trend is down over last
  few days, 09:45 - up to the downtrend, but no break through,
  12:12 - This broke upwards for +$1000 gain if long, interesting how the ones that catch my eye
  for a day are usually movers!,
  GBP 10:21 - double bottom, 4/6-4/7

* Mon Apr  5 06:33:39 2010 rpc - My sense is that CL is cyclical, so looking at
See /share/Snapshots/CL/CL-040610-GuessAndReality.jpg
  ProRealTime chart to get long term sense of cycles involoved,
  7/13/09-09/25/09, 09/25/09-12/11/09, 12/11/09-02/05/10, these sort of bouncy ~7-11 week
  cycles are obvious from the bottom of the fall, ~12/08-2/09, a slow doubleing over that period,
  

* Mon Mar 29 03:37:24 2010 rpc - CL is on my mind again, seems an up proposition,
  ADX - When the -di is aggressive about getting above +di, fast drop, adx is up there,
        watch 4 period on hour bars
        NOTE: - when the -di an +di come at each other at a steep angle, more significant,
        
  CL - Range bound, last few days, 82.12-79.68, even though its up over last few hours, looks very
  questionable, and the drops are much faster than the rises

  06:38 - My intuition and ADX would have netted 500, but the BBs look questionable, so didn't go
  It just exploded up, never touched the bottom of the BB,

* Wed Mar 24 04:55:45 2010 rpc - About 4 days ago, CL occured to me,
  how did it do?, There was one big up, 2 days ago, looks very cyclic overall,
  

* Tue Mar 16 13:42:19 2010 rpc - Woke up thinking about ZS and in an "up" way,
  it rose for profit of $500, if trade had been entered,

* Mon Mar  8 16:40:07 2010 rpc - I am looking at my DrawDownCalcWithPeriod, and thinking
  that I should break each indicator out seperately, and combine them through an aggregator,
  Also, use time rather than bar intervals,
  I've downloaded ta-lib and have the java sources, in JavaDev/ta-lib, and ta-lib0.4, also,
  have all sources in /share/ta-lib, c++, net, etc, most of the functionality is in one monster
  file called Core.java, which is generated?,

* Thu Mar  4 04:23:45 2010 rpc - I have been working on the PeTraSys,
  and am making progress, architectural concerns now arise about the trading mechanism,
  notes so far are in code and notes-jsystemtrader,

* Mon Feb 15 12:44:16 2010 rpc - Building my trading system, working currently on
  the DrawDownCalc, which needs some careful definition, (names are columns in db)
  - The "largestDrawDown" is looking forward in time, the largest drawdown from a high,
    So, "highestPriceBeforeDrawdown" is used as the high end of the calculation, and compared
    against the low of each day to see if the drawdown is increased,
  - The "largestGain" is from the originating close, and will be the greatest gain going forward
    before a max drawdown, or the end of the data (future dev may add a time constraint here),

* Fri Feb  5 11:01:28 2010 rpc - Regarding my recent prediction,
  GBP - predicted down on 1/25 5am, was around 1.614, currently 1.556 (@11:03),
  got up to 1.62765, $625 for each penny, so, ~750 drawdown, current sell would be
  ~3500 win,

  See notes-gimp for using Gimp for visualization/intuition practice,

* Wed Feb  3 12:33:06 2010 rpc - The download link for the Java Webstart form TWS
  http://www.interactivebrokers.com/java/classes/tws.jnlp?

* Mon Jan 25 05:01:43 2010 rpc - Have created a new approach, based on bar charts,
  printing the charts and reading the future from them
  GBP - 05:02 - looking for a general down movement over next few days,

* Sun Jan 24 17:44:53 2010 rpc - Working on a new way of visualizing,
  making partial charts, then filling in the future,

* Thu Jan 21 10:51:30 2010 rpc - Testing the concept of visualizing
  "where the chart is going",
  ZW - 

* Mon Jan 18 12:25:17 2010 rpc -
  ZW - still dropping like a rock!
  CL - sure looks like a downtrend
  AUD - Trending up but flattening out
  ZT - 2yr treasury definitely trending up last week or so,
  ZC - very down, but big purchase 1/13, setup for rise
       * Wed Jan 20 10:44:13 2010 rpc - Down below where purchases took place,
  ZN - 1/15 purchase large, currently down, but remaining within purchase region
  GBP - has a large purchase on 12/30, and on 1/10, started up which is the pattern
        appearing in above 3, with ZT having a buying range from 108'015 to 108'245,
        ~20cents, 

* Fri Jan 15 05:43:21 2010 rpc -
  ZW - looks like it could bip up over next 10 days,
       big drop on 1/12

* Wed Jan  6 02:02:27 2010 rpc - Chart reading Found a new program
  SHUTTER - that works good for annotating screenshots, but seems to have trouble
            with the dailies from ProRealTime, but take the snapshot with SHUTTER, and it
            works, but the name isn't as descriptive
  ZC - generally looks still up, but not at a buy point, so wait,
  ZW - seeing a similar thing, tightening range, but up, this is given 100 by INO on 1/4,
  NG - Seeing a downtrend over last 6 days, Could this bounce up a bit, then tumble again?
       watch around 7am, 08:48 - Shot up like a rocket!, NG is so volatile,
  ***SMOOTH TRENDING*** - find mkts that are smooth trending, i.e., the drawdowns, read ATRs,
                          are reasonably small, and the trends are reasonably persistent, NG
                          definitely does not fit that profile, Financials, Currencies, and
                          Ags come to mind,

* Mon Jan  4 09:37:43 2010 rpc - ZC was my focus on waking up early,
  I thought down, but up was predicted, the big move today so far is down,

* Wed Dec 30 08:01:16 2009 rpc - Yesterday's losses were disheartening,
  Obviously need more work,
  ZS - Yesterday at 9:03 it broke through resistance at 1032, if I'd entered a quick trade,
       or had a stop at 1032 working, could have made 200 in 20min, but automation is the only
       way for that sort of thing, a specification is that I don't want to have to sit in front
       of a screen all morning!, so, time frame comes into focus again, or setting exits and entries
       that take care of things automatically,
  CL - yesterday's trade picked a high, unfortunately, went the wrong way, looking at this trade
       off of drawdown/gain, cyclic-redundancy, i.e., repeating cycles, right now, 09:21 - 79.59,
       from my entry yesterday, I would have sustained a 1330 drawdown to be back to breakeven today
  RB - 4000 rise in last few days, but again, pretty steep drawdowns, the draw down tolerance has
       everything to do with how the trade is made

* Tue Dec 29 04:19:30 2009 rpc - Yesterday's results were far from remarkable, biggest
  gains were missed, 
  ZS - this was biggest miss yesterday: wonked out of a range about 7:30, climbed until 11,
       then coasted down in light trading since 4pm yesterday til now @04:46 -
  NG - 05:12 - Daily: +50, Hourly:+70, 5min: big drop on 5/24 is paralyzing, short term volatility
       is too rich for my blood,
  CL - 05:27 - Set alarm for breakout, 78-79.20, all 3 time zones are up,
       06:07 - Up alarm off, in at 79.35, 500 stop loss
       It hit the stop, $500 loss or more,
  EUR - 05:36 -  Hourly: +5, Daily:? 5min:+60 revisit soon, 05:45 - Definitely looks like it is going up,
      

* Mon Dec 28 06:55:41 2009 rpc - The lotus rises from the mud,
  What is its raison d'être, its reason for being?,
  A general rule seems to be evolving, trade if greater than +150, or less than -150
  
  CL - (thought of a big slippery fish...), Daily: +60, Hourly: +70, 5min: + 40,
       so, another long, same params, 07:03 - 78.72, 10:05 - 79.00, up $280
       13:13 - 78.70 at close, 79.06 hi for day, 78.60 lo, so a no action poop,
  NG - Daily: +40, Hourly: +30, 5min: 0, leave it alone, 13:16 - did better, up~$600
  GBP - Daily: -55, Hourly: -30, 5min: -20 - rose ~$60
  ZW - Daily: +40, Hourly: +10, 5min: +20 - up ~$250
  ZS - Daily: +40, Hourly: 0, 5min: 0 - up~$1000
  JPY - Daily: -20, Hourly: -10, 5min: 0 - down~$187
  AUD - Daily 0, Hourly: +10, 5min: -5 -down a bit but up next day
  EUR - Daily -30, Hourly: +10, 5min: 0 - down but rising next day

* Thu Dec 24 07:02:28 2009 rpc - Now I am looking at 3 time frames for
  CL - Daily: +70, Hourly: +50, 5min: + 40,
       So, go long, 500 limit loss, 700 target profit,
       07:08 - In at 77.09, target profit reached at ~10:30, short day, closed at 77.75,
               good trade!
  I had the limit loss and ul in mind before the day started, this is encouraging, 

               
* Wed Dec 23 12:01:20 2009 rpc - I believe that an automated system,
  that I build and control myself, so that I can alter it when needed,
  is the way to go, so looking at JSystemTrader again, it still has some life around it,

* Tue Dec 22 07:42:51 2009 rpc - So, what are we going to see today?,
	I forgot to turn on the internet, and the coffee warmer, am I forgetting to turn
  on something, some current, for to help me trade?,
  NG - 07:53 - down to 5.585 this morning, 

* Mon Dec 21 06:23:19 2009 rpc - So, knowing that everything here will pass,
  and that the body, fingers, even the internet, will one day be gone and forgotten,
  this is the reality we work within,
  NG - on the move, downward this tim7e, but still within upward trend, to catch the waterfall drop,
       should have been in at 5 - 5:15 or so, too late now,
       12/21/09 07:27 Mon - Based on "glob analysis", exepect a drop next hour from 5.659,
       12/21/09 15:24 Mon - Always trades heaviest between 5:30am-11:30am,
       Never really fell more, flattened out pretty much,
  EUR - could fall, looks like it might in the short term, though it is climbing long term,
        waggled down a bit over the day, 
  CL - if I don't have a way of trading that keeps me calm, I don't want to trade at all,
       the rest of the workd can lose it's head, but I choose to stay calm,
  SO - Right Livelihood?, has to be service to the good, how does that look? What would it be,
       more physical? Do I really need that much money?
  

* Fri Dec 18 14:53:29 2009 rpc - Continuing,
  taking losses, and realizing that even intuition is probabilistic,
  CL - 73.05 - 2200 gain from Tues, never went below Tues close, but, with trail,
       probably would have been out at 72 or so, 

* Tue Dec 15 15:53:05 2009 rpc -
  CL - at 70.85, has climby look about it,

* Tue Dec 15 05:23:00 2009 rpc - I'm looking for ways to make 10K or so a week,
  NG - definitely in an uptrend, this is what market club says:
       +10	Last Hour Close Above 5 Hour Moving Average
       +15	New 3 Day High on Monday
       +20	Last Price Above 20 Day Moving Average
       +25	New 3 Week High, Week Ending December 12th
	     -30	New 3 Month Low in December
       +70	Total Score
       But looking at ProRealTime, definite long term downtrend since Jul08,
       and much more consistent ~20day downtrends since then, so right now, looks like it may trend up
       a little more, then crash,
       12/15/09 06:21 Tue - Looking like a short term uptrend,
       * Tue Dec 15 11:28:18 2009 rpc - Still climbin'!
       So dead wrong, but the chart told me that,
       
   CL - could be at the bottom of a ~2mo cycle, but hard to tell,
        -10	Last Hour Close Below 5 hour Moving Average
	      -15	New 3 Day Low on Friday
	      -20	Last Price Below 20 Day Moving Average
	      -25	New 3 Week Low, Week Ending December 12th
	      +30	New 3 Month High in October
        -70	Total Score

        So many of these mkts are so choppy, like CL, that catching a long ride is just not
        happening, how do you get the chop out?, how do you find a trending mkt?
        Am I doing a foolish thing, pursuing this, rather than devoting my time to something else?,
        what though?

* Mon Dec 14 10:16:32 2009 rpc - Left NG blank yesterday, so?....,
  NG - the excitement/dread, of WAITING---, its at 5.233@12/14/09 10:20 Mon -
       did bip down a little, but back up - , last few hours showing a slide, down,
       behavior.
  CL - not quite as sown as NG, but similar,

* Sun Dec 13 13:03:09 2009 rpc - A strong sense of a drop in NG,
  NG - 

* Thu Dec 10 13:20:03 2009 rpc - So, every day this week is recorded, so far
  NG - .3 drop on 12/09, worth 3k, then turned other way today, 3.5k, what a seesaw,
       watch for the next breakout,
  CL - Here we go with a range, waiting for a breakout
  ZW - A bit flat over last 2 days, but definitely still downtrend, 

* Wed Dec  9 10:27:23 2009 rpc - morning recap and predictions,
  CL - did indeed slide, 2k per contract, but seems at the end of a big drop, not good short,
       go long? soon...
  ZW - Another good call, downtrend continues, want to get a sense of long term trend,
       looking at ProRealTime chart, Looks to me like downtrend will still continue,
       good short entry,
  ZS - plunged today, whole mkt is down like a big dog, whats' h'pnin?, spect it to go up soon,
  
* Tue Dec  8 13:06:04 2009 rpc - So a little review,
  CL - continues it's precipitous drop, could go down to 68,
  ZW - went down from yesterday, double bot meant nothing in 5min chart,
       both of above ARE IN Downtrends,
  ZS - Uptrend, flatenning out,
  EUR - dropped out of a range
  GBP - downtrend,
  NG - going down again

* Mon Dec  7 06:29:26 2009 rpc - Todays check outs
  ZW - feels active, need to look at chart, definite down trend last wk,
       Double boob in 5min chart, could be up...
  ZS - because it seems linked to ZW, looks like it will crawl up,

  -- check out currencies,
  AUD - slight retracement, could bip up, lots of chop, no clear signal,
  JPY - precipitous drop over last few days, could move up too,
  the above two make me think the dollar is in for a suprise drop, oops!,

  Remember that the price of futures on Notes and Bonds is inverse to interest rate,
  i.e., rates go up, their prices go down, rates go down, their prices go up,
  If you have a treasury that pays 6% face, then its worth more if the rates are lower than 6%,
  because the payout is greater than the prevailing rate,

  Well, nothing popped this morning, going back to bed,


* Sun Dec  6 13:38:07 2009 rpc - Checking the below predictions;
  YM - There was actually more action to the downside, minimal to upside,
  ZT - Good prediction, nice map, two days would have been healthy profit,
  CL - small down, fair up, then radical down,
  ** all of these were on a 2-3 day basis,

* Tue Nov 24 15:02:25 2009 rpc - Checking things out for starters,
  YM,  ZT, and CL are the immediate targets,
  YM - Will probably see some sor tof climb over next few days,
  ZT - A very short term down, then up,
  CL - Could be falling off again, don't know

  Good out last Friday, they all have reversed,

* Fri Nov 20 12:24:32 2009 rpc - Everything is closed out,
  Total profit is 4942.30 - not quite 5k;
  NG - 354.5
  ZW - 1743.9
  ZS - 2843.9



* Thu Nov 19 12:24:43 2009 rpc - Gave back some this morning,
  NG is now showing profit of 357.20, down from 11.07 yesterday,
     this is ging against the trend in Comodities, which is up,
     bought it back, 354.50 realized profit
  ZW has lost some profit, down from 2209 to to 2059,
     tightened up stop
  ZS is actually the winner, 2846 profit today, up from 1996!
     too late to sell it, but put an order in, at limit current price 1046,
     check this later,

* Wed Nov 18 13:55:50 2009 rpc - The trifecta is looking good today,
  Up over 5k!,
  NG - down to 4.26, profit right now at 1147.20, might expect a couple of flat days now,
       I really still expect it to move down, so leaving open,
  ZW - Is looking worrisome, still up nicely, but wondering where the juice is,
       still up re trend, visit this tomorrow,
  ZS - Beaners are still pumping up, have to watch them close too,

  So, this trading started 11/10, and in 8 days I have a 5k paper profit, that is
  very satisfying, the intuitive side needs the spiritual development to continue
  strongly, so that the intuitive sense is strong and clear, Also, the extraneous garbage
  that arises from the samskaras needs to be cleaned away,

* Tue Nov 17 12:14:42 2009 rpc - Up over 1600 today,
  NG is down 1722, ZW up 2109, ZS up 1221,

* Mon Nov 16 11:06:12 2009 rpc - Taking a bit of a beating in NG,
  down 2312 right now, ZS are beaning along, but just don't know,
  ZW is also showing gain, and not yet close to target,

* Sun Nov 15 17:17:25 2009 rpc - The ags are working out, but NG isn't shrinking,
  its growing, uwwah-uwwah, and down 633,
  NG - 2.95 is in the mind
  ZW - 7.35 would be oh so sweet wheat!
  ZS - I just don't know,

* Fri Nov 13 11:35:55 2009 rpc - Where have my positions ended up today?
  Trusting that all things work for the best, and exercising trading the way I exercised
  my bowels, letting the mantra penetrate all aspects of it, my mind is fixed on my
  highest purpose

* Thu Nov 12 10:20:48 2009 rpc - Discovering that wheat actually is reported in cents
  means it is a viable contract to trade,
  ZW - Wheat still looking strong,
  ZS - soybeans, expanding bean - 992 limit buy at 12:28 
  NG - shrinking flame

  

* Wed Nov 11 12:38:04 2009 rpc - The intention and commitment to become an
  expert chart reader, 

* Mon Nov  9 10:18:10 2009 rpc - Starting up TWS and looking at my futures,
  my future?, clarity of being, clarity of insight, this requires freedom from
  samskaras, the samskaras cause me to go off into fantasies when a perception
  is suggestive,
  NG - had the last week of Oct in Snapshots, and based on first look, imagine down last week,
     good call, would have been profitable,

  Wheat is going up!;-:),

* Sat Nov  7 12:11:20 2009 rpc - In the interest of future events,
  working on the jFreeChart stuff in Eclipse,

* Wed Nov  4 13:10:52 2009 rpc - I have to get bak on the horse,
	
* Fri Oct 30 12:17:16 2009 rpc - To understand and go deeper into my trading,
  I'm focusing on /share/Snapshots, how about looking at the coming week?, much longer time frame
  than I've been concentrating on, 

* Wed Oct 28 12:22:49 2009 rpc - The CRB index is something to watch,
  there is a video at http://broadcast.ino.com/education/crbindex1025/?campaignid=3,
  this is the Reuters/Jefferies/CRB Index (NYBOT_CR)

* Tue Oct 27 15:40:42 2009 rpc - I am still making consistently bad calls,
  Seems I am so out of it, 

* Tue Oct 27 04:41:47 2009 rpc - Concentrating on the notes-tws,
  get the downloading done,

* Mon Oct 26 12:32:05 2009 rpc - Different time of day to be looking...
  NG 10/26/09 13:15 Mon -  Is down from 10/21, about 70cents, which is $7000, say I'd gotten in at 5.13, when
                           noticed it tanking, right now at 4.526, for profit of 6040,
                           max drawdown of 840 one heckofa good trade!,
  CL 10/26/09 13:23 Mon - Range bound from 81.75-79.50, since 10/21, a 2250 range! Jeez!,
                          So, what could be done with this? looking at the 1min chart, a simple
                          counting min bars down, 5 in a row seems appropriate, same with the big run up that
                          happened on 10/21,
                          
  

* Fri Oct 23 05:41:52 2009 rpc - I think setting the stops is my biggest challenge,
  today, lost on a tight stop again,
  What about playing the runs?> if it stops running in my direction, get out!,
  To play a longer term the risk is greater per contract,

  I'm going to look at cycles, and putting  together a set of cycles in such a way that
  a given chart is mirrored,

* Wed Oct 21 05:16:55 2009 rpc - PreMkt insights
  the deeper I go into meditation, the more time I spend doing the practices,
  the closer I draw to the Truth, time to give up illusions?,
  10000 * x = 400, x = 400/10000

  NG - 10/21/09 05:47 Wed - watching for a macd crossover, then it will be headed up
       10/21/09 05:52 Wed - looking less likely, dropping a bit,
       10/21/09 06:32 Wed - Cross over, bto at 5.23 stop at 5.09, that's 1400! to get a 400
                            stop, would have to be $0.04, so 5.05, high of 5.292, so would have been out
                            at 5.25, for $200 profit, 
       10/21/09 06:50 Wed - To trade this in a range I'm comfortable with, would need to trade off the
                            1 min charts,
       10/21/09 08:15 Wed - has tanked, down to 5.13, or $1000 loss from entry, the small stop above would
                            have been the best bet,
                

  CL - 10/21/09 05:56 Wed - very downward, CCI is pitted, could turn up,
       10/21/09 06:37 Wed - Breaking upwards, but macd lines below 0?,
       10/21/09 08:17 Wed - had a nice run upwards at 7:30, hit 80.05 at 7:45, from 78.45,
                            so nice $1500 run,
       10/21/09 10:38 Wed - Its up to 81.75,                            

  ZN - 10/21/09 07:01 Wed - definite downtrend,
       10/21/09 08:22 Wed - not much happening, could have gotten in at 118'02, and ridden it down to
                            117'30, a total of 4 points, or $125
       

* Tue Oct 20 12:13:46 2009 rpc - See
  notes-tws for how my app is going to be built,
  
* Tue Oct 20 06:34:08 2009 rpc - Woke up with this sense that
  NG would be climbing, and boy was it!, but now it's flattening, looks like it hit a
     resistance, so that's a wait and see,
  CL Broke out of that H&S I've been watching for 2 months!, so, should be a mighty upward heave,

  My sense is that both of the above are long term up, how should I work these?,

  Those are the 2 to watch,
  Meanwhile, back at the ranch, interest rates are down, the $ looks flat to up, up against
  CAD and AUD, down against EUR, JPY and GBP,
  so these are my 3 sesnses, interest rates, currencies and raw energy,

* Mon Oct 19 14:35:17 2009 rpc - I am going to send all my snapshots to
  my flickr site, that's the easiest way to gather them,
* Mon Oct 19 05:08:18 2009 rpc - Looking at
  CL - that last thurs. move  was the biggest in some time,
       most of the big move are occuring from 7-10am, a little later than I thought,
       BZ is Brent, and trades almost not at all according to IB
    macd5-10 1hr looks like it wants to break to the upside,
    CCI 1hr has been trending down, but  little upturn at end,
        most of the steepest moves lately have been up,
    BOL 1hr could be a flat day,
    ADX getting same pinched feeling, no signal yet,
    Expectation? - upside downside 60/40,
    * Mon Oct 19 06:00:17 2009 rpc - CL is starting to climb, this would be a buy in
      at ~79 with .3 trail, so there is the "getting the position on" attutude, then we
      get to the "have a position on" attitude, what do we do here? Taken out with a 300 loss!
      recap, didn't feel very strong, maybe 80% max, 60% more realistically,

    * Mon Oct 19 07:41:23 2009 rpc - In again at 79.27, with a wider stop, 570, so 78.70, leave
      it alone til 12noon or so, * Mon Oct 19 12:04:08 2009 rpc - at 79.77, high of day was 80.05,
      low since open, 78.62 out at eod fro 430 profit if able to bear 650 drawdown, so, again, those
      drawdowns have to be a lot riskier,

  A valid indicator might be the acceleration of change of the MA lines, ie, moving up, and faster
  now than 1 hr ago, which was faster the 2 hrs ago, etc, indicates trend,

  I'm forcing myself to stay on the charts until 8am, and starting at 5, so 3 hrs on the charts,

  NG - some of its recent big moves start as early as 4, but seldom after 7am
     macd - getting same slowness as CL, makt hasn't awakened yet,

  HO - expecting a strong move up soon, how can I work this?

  If there is inflation, of large magnitude, it should push commodity prices up a lot, so
  that's upward pressure on commodities,

  I think I might set the stops a little wider, 300 for CL should maybe be greater, look into
  this,

* Fri Oct 16 06:57:22 2009 rpc - Started the morning watching NG, which kept moving up
  a huge amount, then ZB, 30yrBond, and it also was moving up, I'm attracted to up movers,
  

* Thu Oct 15 05:49:35 2009 rpc - MonkeyStudio didn't seem to work out, looking now at
  Eclipse and JSystemTrader again, leaning towards parting out stuff I can use into an RCP app,
  
  What about CL moving up today?, - * Thu Oct 15 14:49:05 2009 rpc - Up $2(2k)
  EUR could break upwards, - up 0.005 (625)
  So! could have done good with faith and conviction!,
  

* Wed Oct 14 06:53:11 2009 rpc - I'm taking a break from choosing daily futures
  to develop a system,see notes-monkeystudio

* Sat Oct 10 07:00:04 2009 rpc - I'm looking through the inventory of trading products,
  and trying to find what fits, TA-LIB is my starting place this morning, very frustrating day,
  felt like none of the existing software fit my needs,

* Thu Oct  8 09:35:27 2009 rpc - I think the longer term patterns are what need playing,
  and for that, a program like QtStalker is more useful, and also, it gives me a way to really
  contribute to humanity, control of the mind is crucial, and conservation of personal energy,

  I am looking at ways to develop that are the most universal and useful, thus ddd, and emacs

* Wed Oct  7 11:44:00 2009 rpc - Looking at ActiveQuant,
  see notes-activequant for details,

* Tue Oct  6 06:38:19 2009 rpc - To trade successfully, I need more than just price action,
  that's what the intuition is about, and the deeper knowledge that comes from pursuing that
  intuition, God, Guru, same thing, Self, Recovering deeply buried memories is tough, but the
  quest for understanding makes it necessary,

  copied 1min data files from 1Tera backup drive, they are at /share/CsvIB and /share/CsvFromAmi
  the data in those files is in this format,
  Symbol, Date, Time, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
  
* Mon Oct  5 05:34:16 2009 rpc - Right effort, looking at the charts, understanding them,
  paying attention to what I see, this is my right effort, with the macd5-10, if the short term
  5 period line is widening out from the long 10 period line, if it is above, rising sign, if it is
  below, falling sign, IF the trend of the lines are in the same direction, ie, down for falling,
  up-trending lines for rising,

* Fri Oct  2 04:57:33 2009 rpc - Dealing with the "money is evil" belief,
  this is a big stumbling block to trading successfully, trading can be successful, if Guru
  is behind it, otherwise, why bother?,

* Wed Sep 30 05:01:55 2009 rpc - Time to delve into the fray, to take up the sword of truth,
  to smite the ugly dragon of fear and loathing, Watch Bhairava, that is the way to teleportation,
  On the 1 hr charts I begin to see patterns that seem to hold, on smaller time frames, it is very difficult,
  very murky, 

* Tue Sep 29 16:21:17 2009 rpc - Looking for charting software on Linux,
  * Mon Oct  5 05:35:40 2009 rpc - I have found QtStalker, which I am developing, along with a lot
    of others,

* Mon Sep 28 06:13:32 2009 rpc - Still confused, and not even knowing if this is going to continue,
  Seeking inner guidance,  Where do I go from here? Always trade on an excess of positive signals, never
  on a dirth, and certainly not on an absence,
  

* Sat Sep 26 14:31:53 2009 rpc - JBookTrader doesn't get data on last trade prices,
  but rather on the "book", the bids and asks, and the number of contracts at each b/a price,
  i.e., the market depth, not what I've looked at before, 

* Wed Sep 23 07:17:02 2009 rpc - The prices move so funny on these things,
  I feel like I don't even have a clue, I guess you could say I'm waiting to feel
  something, and when you're hot, you're hot, when you're not, you're not,
  My "intuition" is so far off, it is not even funny, let's look for right-livelihood,
  What is my right livelihood?, Shambo, Shambala, Shambuki,

* Tue Sep 22 06:27:59 2009 rpc - 90% of stuff I see in the charts is untradable,
  of the other 10%, 2% makes me feel sure, if it doesn't jump out at you pretty fast,
  probably not there, don't trade inside the triangle, too tight, too range bound,
  ZT, the 2yr treasury, is trending down, which makes sense with rising interest rates,

* Mon Sep 21 07:11:36 2009 rpc - Trends are the missing piece,
  To be able to effectively identify trends, I need tools for spotting them,
  that's why using the chart templates is useful,
  CCI - there should be a setting that gives you a useful 0 crossing, the trade
        follows the direction of the line, 

* Fri Sep 18 10:40:15 2009 rpc - Feeling like I need something more for
  analyzing these charts, the approach I have is insufficient,

* Wed Sep 16 05:22:15 2009 rpc - Have taken up Montage, which is a program
  that is capable of manipulating images in some pretty incredible ways, but to get
  it to put out the sort of thing I'm envisioning for the blog, I need Python, or
  something, to get it to put the snapshots together properly, also, for perusing the
  pictures, emacs is awesome,
*** - Morning take - 09/16/09 06:51 Wed -
    Watched NG for quite a while, felt nothing definite enough to bet on,

* Tue Sep 15 07:23:35 2009 rpc - Using the Shutter program didn't work too well, but the
  Alt-PrntScrn works great, as it chooses the title for the shot name, which works out good,
  

*** - Morning take - 09/15/09 07:01 Tue -
    NG - up again over 4%, seems to be in a real uptrend, but rignt now it's plunging,
    over the last 2hrs, down 20cents, or 2000$, so, violent movements have continued,
    where to next? watching it, I made a very good guess about direction, but would have
    had to act very fast to get in on it, using 1 min charts may be too fast for me,
    

* Mon Sep 14 15:40:00 2009 rpc - The ill behaved TWS needed to be killed, and
  since there were other java processes running, had to find it somehow, this worked,
  ps -aux | grep javaws.Main

* Mon Sep 14 05:50:33 2009 rpc - I am being led to believe that Eclipse is
  better for my development than NetBeans, so moving into that, I may
	do better ignoring technical studies, they seem to get in the way of
	pure visual chart reading, I believe that watching all my
	candidates, is better than just watching one, watching one is
	appropriate when I'm in the position, or ready to move in, then the
	one should be watched the whole time,
*** Record your impressions, then come back the next day, and comment ***  
  CAD - narrow hole, sounds like down,
**(Should time stamp these)  Moved up nicely,
  GBP - spinning frisby on a stick, balanced,
**Went up  
  AUD - having trouble getting any sensation, seems to be hopeful, up,
** How it worked out - 09/14/09 16:04 Mon - - Did go up
  ES - a pitbull, rip your face off, all about revenge, not playing, taking off list,
  JPY - a whirlpool, down
** How it worked out - 09/14/09 16:06 Mon - - Made nice  move up, then down,   
  ZB - 30 Year US Treasury Bond, Owners hung out to dry, price goes	up,
  EUR - Cold, climbing a mountain,
  HO - switch backs, no consequence,
  ZN - 10 Year US Treasury Note, stalled, will drop a little, then climb,
  ZF - 5 Year US Treasury Note, interesting deadness, no volume,
  NG - Violent movements will continue for some time,
** How it worked out - 09/14/09 16:08 Mon - - Up and away!,  
  ZT - 2 Year US Treasury Note, short term, looking over a cliff, 
Most everything was up for the day,
These are so far off it's scary, doesn't seem very lucrative, practice,?,

* Sat Sep 12 11:06:55 2009 rpc - I have the basic JFreeChart test
  working here, in Debian Lenny, inside of NetBeans development environment,
  see "NetBeans" below for TWS apps, See notes-netbeans for dev env specific stuff,
  
* Fri Sep 11 06:41:46 2009 rpc - I feel too discombubulated to trade today,
  I'll practice later, I moved the notes-tradingd writing into here,
	so it is all together again, 

* Thu Sep 10 06:09:08 2009 rpc - CL has that head and shoulder formation,
  stretching back a couple months, so expecting an up move eventually,
	09/10/09 07:23 Thu - - starting to look like a move is coming, as
	soon as the 30min macd crosses, entering a buy to open, 
  lost 540 trading CL up, in the menatime, NG was a 2k gainer
	beginning at 7:30, and I wasn't watching it!, very harsh day!, 

* Wed Sep  9 08:03:24 2009 rpc - It looks to me that over the next 2 months
  CL will climb up, watch for a break above 75.27, the high of 6/11/09,
  Wikipedia has good technical indicator articles
  NG did go down beginning at 9am, just like I thought it would,

* Tue Sep  8 06:42:02 2009 rpc - Designing a new page layout that allows
  me to see the money action clearer, big numbers, created a 2 page layout,
  one the same as before, one with fewer columns, to concentrate on
	the dance, and disabled left-click for buy sell, 

* Wed Sep  2 07:21:52 2009 rpc - Starting up TWS on linux,
  Looking closely at NG, seems to be a sell opportunity preparing
	itself, Multiplier for NG is 10,000, which means that every 1cent
	change in price is work $100, Its been dropping for a long time, and
	that makes me nervous, ATR/day is around .25, or 2,500, ATR/hr is
	round .03, or 300, definitely feeling a down bias here,
* Wed Sep  2 11:01:04 2009 rpc - a few hrs later, 1,000 could have
	been made, this was a right prediction

* Mon Aug 31 06:45:20 2009 rpc - Amazing how disoriented I get
  just because JoEllen got up early and made a lot of noise, why does that bother me?

  Indicator - If trending up, watch for touching botoom of BBs, then buy, if trending down,
	watch for touching top of BBs, sell, 

  Lots of trouble with web down time, is Qwest just too lacking in capabilities?,

* Fri Aug 28 06:40:59 2009 rpc - Starting out a bit disjointed,
  entered wrong user name in TWS, then wrong PW, thinking about Debian, AMI, which is Max
	somehow, what is it I need to do right now, right here?, I can't focus my eyes yet,
  SI, on 8/25, thought it was up, had this intuition of up, and since then it has been down
	as much as (14.47-14.045)*5000=2125 but today is up (14.865-14.47)*5000=1975 off the high
	on 8/25, the low was on 8/27 between 8 and 9am, an its up (14.865-14.045)*5000=4100 off of
	that, I drew some lines on the silver chart that are very well placed, I need to make
	pictures and notes when I do this, Using OpenOffice SpreadSheet is the way to go for this,
	getting it to the blog is incidental, and can be dealt with, 

* Thu Aug 27 06:31:20 2009 rpc - Seems CL went down most of the day,
  CHF went from .935 around 5:30 yesterday to .934 around 8:20, so, using 125000*.001, could
	have made 125 in 3 hours, not very impressive, CHF is off the list, seem to be dropping my
	connections a lot, wonder if its qwest or IB?

  Doing a more complete look at NG today, I need to make a little "notebook" for each entity
	I'm trading, NG, CL, etc., and get a feel for them individually as well as universal
	principles, 

* Wed Aug 26 05:15:00 2009 rpc - From Market Profile,
  looking at the "seeking the most volume" behaviour, idea that they go to where the most
	volume is available, chf the swiss franc, looks like it might be breaking, falling,
  125000, doesn't move enough to be interesting short term,  08/26/09 05:54 Wed - CL looks
	like a breakout, up is 1st guess, Am I an Energy trader?. CL and NG have been my passions
	the last few weeks,
  08/26/09 07:05 Wed - - 2 trades with CL, a net loss of 133, oh well, 

* Tue Aug 25 08:38:47 2009 rpc - SI - Silver, trades a little later in the morning,
  still active up to 10am most days, SI looks up^ and it was 08/25/09 09:41 Tue - - it is up
	about .06, or...06*5000 = 300$, now trending down a tad, I seem to do best with very short
	term trades, maybe that's just the nature of the current mkts, 

* Mon Aug 24 07:11:09 2009 rpc -
  CL - Looks up on the month and 6mo charts, but possibly down on the 1min day, strong long
	term and short term up in ES, which would push CL higher, keep this in the brain, see how
	it gels, gelling CL, 

* Thu Aug 20 07:53:45 2009 rpc - I'm looking at calc-mode, which is entered by M-#,
  you can do a quick calc by entering M-#q, but the yank doesn't seem to work, so moving on
	for now, HG, copper, is a quick moving entity, 2-3k a day is common, 

* Wed Aug 19 06:06:08 2009 rpc - The proper approach is necessary,
  how do I develop that? Breathe easy, meditate, concentrate on your goal, reading the charts
	accurately and making effective predictions, 



  From TWS re Treasuries:
  In TWS click on the View menu at the top of the screen, then on Treasuries. Alternatively,
	you may type "US-T" in the Underlying column on any blank row. You may filter the results
	by your parameters and trade the bond as you would any other instrument.
  For up to $10,000 Face Value commission is $1.00/$1,000 Face Value, minimum $5.00 per order.
  For incremental Face Value > $10,000 commission is 0.025% * Trade Value (2.5 basis points).
  

* Mon Aug 17 06:26:57 2009 rpc - The concentrated movement around a central point,
  are the immediate traders in action, the movements away are forced by  the "active"
	traders, could think of them as tamasic and rajasic, or directional vs stable, 

* Fri Aug 14 06:35:34 2009 rpc - Don't be anzious to trade,
  Relax, and enjoy the play, what you're looking for is to understand it, to grok it, 

* Thu Aug 13 06:28:42 2009 rpc - Watching the 1 min dance,
  

* Wed Aug 12 05:38:57 2009 rpc - There are elements of the mkt that I would like to be able to see,
  change in contract * multi, this would tell me the action available in a contract, volume
	compared to avg volume in a meaningful time period, minute changes probably not
	significant, but daily are, maybe hourly,

  * Wed Aug 12 06:12:07 2009 rpc - If I develop an effective trading technique on just NG, I
	could make a mint, * Wed Aug 12 06:23:15 2009 rpc - double spike down early on 1min, then a
	sharp rise, didn't see it coming, * Wed Aug 12 06:30:28 2009 rpc - I did pick up a little
	drop from the spike up, watching to see how close it comes to hitting my prediction spots, 

* Sat Aug 08 12:12:29 2009 rpc - Working on Java api for TWS,
  In NetBeans, java -jar "C:\Java-TWS\JavaTws1\dist\JavaTws1.jar" builds the app put together
	via directions in C:\Java-TWS\JavaAPIQuickReference.pdf and it runs from command line, but
	not from inside of the ide?, need to understand how Netbeans works to use it effectively,

* Thu Aug 06 12:20:20 2009 rpc - There is a file \jts\futsyms.txt, that
  has active future symbols/exchange pairs, for use in the ContractInfo stuff,
  in C:\data\csharp-projects\IBExcelAddIn1\ContractInfoForm.cs, 

* Thu Aug 06 06:06:36 2009 rpc - See what is happening this morning,
  Stocks are up, fx is down, HO is up again, it moved up nicely yesterday, CL is down, NG is
	down, this is all early premarket, SI and GC both up,
  SI is on, * Thu Aug 06 06:23:43 2009 rpc - out with 295 profit. Still going up, 

* Wed Aug 05 10:14:12 2009 rpc - Have been doing well trading,
  all very fast, all early in the morning,
  Now I'm looking at gathering Contract Info via API, and putting it in an Excel Sheet,

* Wed Jul 29 09:37:38 2009 rpc - Made 604 on CL, but
  out too fast, could have made 1000 more, need to learn to float that stop, 

* Sun Jul 26 15:55:08 2009 rpc - I'm taking all the SQL Server code
  out of IBExcelAddIn1, and renaming yesterday's backup to IBExcelAddIn1WithSqlServer
	
* Thu Jul 23 06:06:35 2009 rpc - Yesterday, made 1104 on paper
  from HG, Natural Gas, today, lost ~325 on JPY, in too late, NG was a trend play, so was
	JPY, this trending is what we need to be able to see, 

* Tue Jul 21 16:32:46 2009 rpc -
  LEFT OFF in C:\data\csharp-projects\IBExcelAddIn1\HistoricDownloadLooper.cs
  Need to put in the lock InLoopingHistoricDownLoad in TE,

* Sat Jul 18 09:36:26 2009 rpc - Looking at a lot of David Elliott's stuff,
  a teacher/mentor, see ~\TOS-Code, 

* Fri Jul 17 06:31:00 2009 rpc - It doesn't take much to overload this laptop,
  Considering that it has 4 gigs of memory, that seems strange,
  Today, I'm going for it, have an IBM call working, and a CL Aug 09 future on, I can reset
	the amount in my paper trade, so my idea is to just jam on it, and see what I can learn,
  If I want to use AmiBroker to track active I need to either send the data via COM of file
	IO, COM seems so slow, but could send each signal easily, file IO is much faster, doesn't
	say much for COM,

  Once again, a trade went off that I didn't understand. I wanted a trailing stop on a short
	and it went off when I didn't want it to, But, the days trades netted 597.98,

  Setting up the code to get Real Time Bars, I don't need a thread, just fire off the
	request, but do need to keep track of symbol, contract number to assign symbol to contract
	number when the data comes through, Probably a static collection in TE class, that just
	holds contract id and symbol name, but, might want a file associated with it too,

  LEFT OFF in C:\data\csharp-projects\IBExcelAddIn1\IBConnectTaskPaneControl.cs,
	realTimeBarFromTWS(), the call into TWS is in
	C:\data\csharp-projects\IBExcelAddIn1\IBRealTimeBars.cs, getRealTimeBarsButton_Click(),
	need to see if an open StreamWriter on a file locks the file, or if I can read it as it's
	being written,

  A way around the "replay" in Ami issue, save a file that is in the time format you want to
	replay, then replay that file, NOT NECEESSARY!!! (and doesn't work!), I found the
	workaround, in File/Database Settings/Intraday Settings, set the Start of Trading day to
	9:01!, Go Figure!,


* Wed Jul 15 12:18:41 2009 rpc - Active this morning,
  and exited a trade with a very smal gain that went on to gain more, seems when I 2nd guess
	myself, I lose, self-trust is good, 


* Tue Jul 14 12:26:43 2009 rpc - Excel Charts 	C:\Charts & Graphs for Excel 2007
  see notes there, 

* Mon Jul 13 17:17:34 2009 rpc - In C:\data\csharp-projects\CSVFileOps\CSVFileOpsForm.cs
  Am getting it going to combine futures contracts with dif expiry, * Tue Jul 14 12:26:31
	2009 rpc -  Have it working,

* Sun Jul 12 12:29:32 2009 rpc - Looking more at the  c:\Charts & Graphs for Excel 2007
  Want to figure out a way to create a "diamonetrics" like grid, 

* Sat Jul 11 14:11:35 2009 rpc - Looking at the 5 yr Treasury future,
  ZF, via Ami and Excel interaction, 

  There is an issue in Ami where it changes the timestamps when doing hourly playback, the
	last stamp, which I use to set buy/sell markers, is always "on the hour" (doing hourly
	backtest), but the stamp changes, I guess aligning with the data, to e.g., 10:29 instead of
	11:00, so stamp isn't right,

  Left off creating code to combine Futures contracts, 

* Sat Jul 11 11:30:11 2009 rpc - Then did Spreads, after buying Cottle's book,
  "Options Trading: The Hidden Reality". And have actually studied quite a bit of it, TOS
	lets you DDE everything re greeks, and price, into excel, 

* Wed Jul 01 16:27:53 2009 rpc - So, after vacilating among
  various spaces, latest, trading spreads, am back to trading single call/put options, buys,
	and using intuitive picking technique, going to construct tabs with 15 stock names, culled
	from the Schaeffer's top volume lists, put each name in put or call pile, see what we get,
  * Sat Jul 11 11:32:07 2009 rpc - This really bombed bad, 

* Tue Jun 23 15:05:38 2009 rpc - I keep coming back to this idea of using Excel Charts,
  and not even using Amibroker at all, this keeps everything in the domain of Excel and C#,
	So, with this in mind, continuing my study of the Charts & Graphs mentioned below, lots of
	issues to resolve, First, saving the stuff to Excel formats, or CSV?, CSV can be accessed
	and parsed directly from C#, and the charts very controlled that way, 

* Fri Jun 19 23:08:10 2009 rpc - Charts & Graphs,
  the book, and its study, is at C:\Charts & Graphs for Excel 2007, see
  See notes-ChartsAndGraphsForExcel2007 in that dir, 

* Thu Jun 18 21:25:09 2009 rpc - 56:10 left on video
  on desktop Al_Brooks_Trading _Best_Price_Action.mov,  about trading,

* Tue Jun 16 11:47:30 2009 rpc - So, there is this issue of the Sql Server,
  Do I really want to use it all the time? I can always import files into it, and if I'm
	going to use Amibroker to view my stuff, then CSV files would be easier, so, I have ~\CsvIB
	which are files from IB that go to Ami, then I have ~\AmiCsv which are files from the Sql
	DB that have been converted to Ami format for importing into Ami, now I'm creating a
	CsvFromAmi, that will contain files that I transfer out of AmiBroker, that might be needed
	later, c:\data\AmiBroker\Formulas\Utils\AllQuotesToCsv.afl is file to do this, there is an
	earler afl file, c:\data\AmiBroker\Formulas\Utils\QuotesToFiles.afl, that does great stuff
	with ranges of dates, instead of all dates, 

* Sun Jun 14 14:36:31 2009 rpc - I'm putting data directly from
  IB into files, instead of the Sql DB, see
	C:\data\csharp-projects\IBExcelAddIn1\IBConnectTaskPaneControl.cs, historicalDataFromTWS(),
	

* Sat Jun 13 15:11:42 2009 rpc - Looking at Ninja Trader,
  which seems to have a free version?
  But, if you want to use it to trade, $1000,

  Let's look at Excel Charts, 

* Tue Jun 09 16:34:21 2009 rpc - Files that are being sent to Ami are
  stashed in ~\AmiCsv, 

* Mon Jun 08 08:03:56 2009 rpc - 	Working in C:\data\csharp-projects\IBExcelAddIn1\PumpHistoricToAmi.cs
  PumpToAmi(), sending the data to Amibroker, created a new function, PumpToAmiViaCSV(), that
	is way faster, the COM quote updates are really slow in comaparison, for real time, have to
	check, 

  The DateTime format is more useful as DateTime2(0), in SqlServer, this gets rid of that
	.000 at the ned of the seconds,

  

* Thu Jun 04 10:21:22 2009 rpc - Have done some code that works
  to get named ranges, etc, from Excel in C#, not obvious!, see
  C:\data\csharp-projects\IBExcelAddIn1\IBRibbon.cs, AmiDBButton_Click(),
  This code gets the options, stocks, and/or futures that want to get put into Ami, now
	working on the part to actually pump it to Ami,

  The Intersect method doesn't work as advertised, it gives me the items next to each other
	when a disjoint selection is made, so all that wonderful code to get ranges is not useful
	for this, changing approach to use checked list boxes instead,
  * Mon Jun 08 08:05:40 2009 rpc - Actually got the intersect working by using a different
	iteration method over the set in question, int the IBRibbon/ AmiDBButton_Click() method,
	the intersect is set up, and PumpHistoricToAmi/SetupThePump is called, where the
	collections in the Intersections are iterated over using a foreach on the Cells collection
	contained in the Intersection set, this is oppposed to using an index into the range
	returned by the Intersect call, which logically seems that it should be the same as the
	Cells collection, but is actually it seems a rectangular region that includes all the Cells
	in the Intersection, plus whatever else may be in that rectangular region, 

* Wed Jun 03 03:45:42 2009 rpc - TE.ExcelMacroNoArgs("InsertDaysInTables", true);
  is a sample of runnning a macro in Excel from VSTO code,

  Excel.Interop objects have 100s of undocumented members, use Intellisense, 

* Tue Jun 02 10:35:45 2009 rpc - After horsing around a while,
  Finally got a ADO Command Object to work correctly for calling a Stored Proc, namely the
	[1minForAmi] SP in Options4 Sql Server DB, this code is in
	c:\data\ExcelMacros\AmiBrokerFromSql.bas,

  Excel keeps crashing, and I think it's because of the queries in DaysInTable.xltm, so,
	going to approach it defferently, build the stuff in code, 

* Mon Jun 01 12:09:05 2009 rpc - Working in the VBA code,
  so we have Amibroker, connectiong to Excel, which connects to SQL Server, and Interactive
	Brokers, Some VBScrip code in the AFL file that is doing the "Bar Replay" trades in
	Amibroker, in c:\data\AmiBroker\Formulas\indicators-ricks\dd1.afl, and a new BAS file in
  c:\data\ExcelMacros\VSTOAddIn.bas that has demo code for calling a C# AddIn function from
	VBA, which essentially means it can be called from anything that does COM, 

* Sun May 31 08:27:36 2009 rpc - Wondering about shapes,
  defining the sorts of shpaes I see in the charts, and superimposing them on the charts, can
	I do that in Excel Charts?,

  I did my 3 symbols, AAPL, WFC, and RIMM on 1 day chart, trading discretionary, 1 trade, a
	win on all, some peculiar behavior where the Excel sheet isn't getting the data after I
	mess with the table. Not sure what thats about!

* Sat May 30 13:34:26 2009 rpc - This stuff with
  Amibroker is enough, I can do it, I will do it, enough, I did it

* Fri May 29 09:53:55 2009 rpc - Not to do Futures for a while,
  but concentrate on Options, which have a non-violate loss characteristic,

* Thu May 28 13:08:37 2009 rpc - There is a Black Scholes implementation
  in VBA that is available as code from
	http://www.power4xl.com/black_scholes/functions/greeks.html,

  Also working in the scripts dir, using vbs scripts because they can connect to a running
	object, ie, excel, like inside AmiBroker, to send data to Excel?
  Instead of Exit, VBScript needs WScript.Quit, 

* Tue May 26 11:48:55 2009 rpc - Working on this idea of
  creating a COM Out of Proc Server, that would be the communicator with AB, haven't found
	the solution yet, no real easy way in C#, maybe VB or C++?, Going to use the dll that
	already works as InProc Server, and keep it running as long as possible, see
  C:\data\csharp-projects\COMOrderServer\COMOrderServer.cs
  

* Mon May 25 15:08:55 2009 rpc - Possible up move ABX
  watch resistance breakout,

* Fri May 22 11:21:12 2009 rpc - Trying to figure out how to
  get AmiBroker aware of the fact that I've set a buy or sell signal, script, afl, indicator,
	exploration, all these are so wierdly coupled,,,plugins, 

* Wed May 20 11:59:39 2009 rpc - Might want to use,
    PlotShapes(shapeSmallUpTriangle*Nz(Vnbuy),colorBrightGreen,   0, L, -10);
    PlotShapes(shapeSmallDownTriangle*Nz(Vnsell),colorRed,   0, H, -10);

* Tue May 19 12:51:56 2009 rpc - Steps for creating the COM Server
  Set up a class lib c# project - see
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa645738(VS.71).aspx for all instructions and
	example,
  Check off Make Assembly COM Visible in Properties, Go to Signing in properties and create a
	Sign the Assembly and create a new Keyname file,
  go to where the dll is created, for the one now its in
	c:\data\csharp-projects\COMOrderServer\bin\Debug and run
  regasm COMOrderServer.dll /tlb:COMOrderServer.TLB
  then run gacutil -i COMOrderServer.dll to register it in the GAC,
  This sets up the server,
  Then setup a script to instantiate and use the server, in this case, see
	~\Scripts\comserver.js,
  EVERYTIME YOU ADD CODE TO THE SERVER you must run regasm and gacutil again,
  Then in AmiBroker, set a User Command in the tools to run the script,

  To keep window always open until its closed, use ShowDialog() instead of Show(),

  There is an issue running
  the Explore, and probably others from the Automatic Anaysis window, the Settings tab time
	interval controls the output, so if your doing a "Bar Replay" in 1 hour bars, make sure and
	set the Settings/General/Periodicity to hourly,

* Tue May 19 10:10:28 2009 rpc - Trying to get the Com Server
  from c# to work, here is the regasm line
  c:\data\csharp-projects\COMInteropPart2\CSharpServer\bin\Debug>regasm CSharpServer.dll
	/tlb:CSharpServer.TLB
  (thats all one line), this said it registered the object ok, I believe Namespace.Classname
	is its ProgID,

  I have code that connects to a C# implemented COM object from Amibroker, the comserver.js
	file in ~/scripts is called, and it connects to the dll implemented in c#

* Mon May 18 13:51:07 2009 rpc - Spending time learning Excel Charts,
  See notes-ExcelCharts

  Here is the command line for registering the C# COM Server,
  regasm "$(SolutionDir)CSharpServer\bin\$(ConfigurationName)\CSharpServer.dll"
	/tlb:"$(ProjectDir)CSharpServer.TLB"



* Sun May 17 17:42:34 2009 rpc - Tried to get
  SqlDependency to work, didn't, see C:\data\csharp-projects\IBExcelAddIn1\IBRibbon.cs,
	moving on to Excel charts, away from Amibroker, because of a very basic incompatibility,
	and Excel charts go with the Inner Guru, Also, need to get compression routines working, to
	expand and collapse a time series to 10min, 1hr, etc,

* Sat May 16 09:28:09 2009 rpc - tlbimp.exe
	is the key to getting COM into Net, for AmiBroker interaction with Excel and c#,  I
	executed "tlbimp Broker4730beta.tlb", this gave Broker.dll, then added a reference in the
	IBExcelAddin1 project, via browse and select Broker.dll, couldn't gt any of this to work,
	but did get a Reflection call to InvokeMember to work!, See
	C:\data\csharp-projects\IBExcelAddIn1\BacktestPane.cs which has a complete working example
	of inserting a quote into Amibroker, and refreshing all!, very cool, the function is
	AmiBrokerConnectButton_Click() in the file above, this could be used to update quotes as
	quotes are coming in, as well as setting up ami from sql db,

	USE master;
GO
ALTER DATABASE Options4
      SET ENABLE_BROKER;
GO
USE Options4;
GO

* Fri May 15 08:53:06 2009 rpc - Have a script, called,
	c:\data\Scripts\GlobalExecutable.js, that successfully opens and exects sql on Sql Server
	DB 2008, this is starting point for feeding quotes to Ami, now going to put loop in
	historic fetch from IB in
	C:\data\csharp-projects\IBExcelAddIn1\IBHistoricGetPaneControl.cs function
	getHistoricClicked(), 

* Thu May 14 13:57:02 2009 rpc - Back to Amibroker,
	How to use it usefully and interoperate, looking at making a COM Server that can be
	accessed inside of AmiBroker, and using the TypeLib for using it in C# programs, typelib
	wouldn't compute on this system, so moving on to jscript, 

* Wed May 13 12:20:21 2009 rpc - I'm concentrating on Futures, and trading with the
	TOS interface, right now looking at what seems to be an error in my historic reading
	function, 

* Tue May 12 13:17:19 2009 rpc - I'm going to use my own entries, based on a chart reading, then test
	against an exit strategy that includes a max loss allowable, checking out the
	TradeFinder.cpp code, trouble with the connection string?
	Data Source=RICKSSTUDIO;Initial Catalog=Options3;Integrated Security=True
	Data Source=RICKSSTUDIO;Initial Catalog=Options4;Integrated Security=True
	problem resolved, it was a table not the string,

	AmiBroker has the step method for going through trades, If I'm going to be a discretionary
	trader, which is what I am, the mechanical stuff just doesn't interest me, then that's my
	practice, stepping through trades, then use IB or TOS charts to trade realtime, 

* Mon May 11 12:32:19 2009 rpc - I'm building a bactest pane
	that will run backtests, and use entry/exit rules that are runnable in realtime for
	tradinga as well as backtesting, 

* Sat May 09 08:42:03 2009 rpc - Looking at research sites, found
	  Money Flows: Market & Sector Overview  at
	http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3022-mfsctrscan-moneyflow.html?mod=mdc_pastcalendar
	which has incredible amount of info,

	Had a heck of a time figuring out how to synch up the first/last dates with value of
	stock/option/future, in combobox, have to do first synch on Load event of the containing
	control/form, and then catch the SelectionChangeCommitted event of the ComboBox,


* Fri May 08 18:36:06 2009 rpc - I'm doing a lot of the code
	just for options and stocks, futures have some work done, but missing a lot, xb
	Left off setting up dates for selected stock and option, and then WAP compare SP in DB, 

* Thu May 07 11:33:35 2009 rpc - I've moved all the document level VSTO
	code over to IBExcelAddIn1, which is an application level addin, which I believe gives me
	a lot more juice, Have created a new workbook template in C:\Users\Rick
	Charon\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\ , directions for this are at
	http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HP101974891033.aspx?pid=CH100648261033 , 

* Wed May 06 13:53:45 2009 rpc - Another lack of symmetry,
	between Document level and Application level controls, the ActionPane class doesn't exist
	for Application level projects, instead you use a TaskPane, 

* Tue May 05 16:32:32 2009 rpc - Have a template excel workbook project now
	IBExcelTemplate1 that works as far as getting data in from db, working on formating, then
	on to graphs, and much more after that, to get the sheet to delink from the datatable, a
	simple call ListObject.Disconnect() does the trick, There tends to be a lack of symmetry
	in the Interop classes, for instance, the Columns.Autofit() worked when the
	ListObject.Autofit() wouldn't, see
	C:\data\csharp-projects\IBExcelTemplate1\IBHistoricGetActionsPaneControl.cs
	GetSheet_clicked(), 

* Mon May 04 12:05:19 2009 rpc - Not excited about Tradelink,
	C#-Excel has caought my attention, interestingly, only in SP1 of VS2008 has the sort of
	support I need appeared!, Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.GetVstoObject() is a
	relevant function, at least for Application level Excel add-ins, for document level
	addins, you're screwed, and thats what I was building, I've reached a point of extreme
	disgust with this whole Visual Studio Office idea, what for? dead ends everywhere, so
	I'm doing a clunky workaround, defining 15 invisible sheets I can control
	programmatically, 

* Sat May 02 16:01:36 2009 rpc - Have quite a bit of database integration, etc,
	in C:\data\csharp-projects\IBExcelWorkbook\IBExcelWorkbook.csproj, which is in IB-CLR
	solution, now want to set entry solution that maps well to 5-12% trailing stop, that would
	be the easiesst to monitor, because it wouldn't require monitoring, at this point,
	monitoring, and exit, seem like the important components, finding an entry that goes with
	a comfortable exit strategy, the Response idea in Tradelink implements something like
	this, should I reuse his code?, I'm going to look at it anyway, installed sample TickData
	in C:\data\csharp-projects\Tradelink\TickData, and going to follow directions on
	http://code.google.com/p/tradelink/wiki/KadinaDocs, 

* Tue Apr 28 13:15:50 2009 rpc - Working in C:\data\csharp-projects\IBExcelWorkbook\IBRibbon.Designer.cs
	Designing the IBExcelWorkbook, discovered that getting the default ribbon to not show up
	requires this.StartFromScratch = true; in the RibbonControl class, see
	C:\data\csharp-projects\microsoft.samples.vsto.ribboncontrols\cs\microsoft.samples.vsto.ribboncontrols\RibbonControls.Designer.cs

            string l;

            {
                l = t.Label;
            }
	Above	shows that there is only the tabs created in app in this.Tabs, where are the default
	tabs listed, and how do you order tabs? in ribbon... very intuitive heehee,
	in the visual ribbon designer, set the Position/PositionType to BeforeOfficeId and
	Position/OfficeId to TabHome to get your ribbontab first in the ribbon, this can be found
	in the C:\zips\ExcelControlIds\ExcelRibbonControls.xlsx file which was installed by

* Wed Apr 22 11:40:29 2009 rpc - I have a c# api to TWS using
	ActiveX - C:\data\csharp-projects\IB-Client\Form1.cs, and discovered that you can enter
	dates as end date way back, so through consecutive 1min 5day downloads, could get data
	going way back, 

* Mon Apr 20 13:39:29 2009 rpc - Getting	the ActiveX component to work
	with C#, in configuration manager, changed the Active Platform to x86, this seemed to
	help, see
	http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/pt-BR/netfx64bit/thread/bd5e628c-5f9f-471d-9546-df7cf5df3539
	I have everthing working, building a C# tattler, to download IB data and chart it, and run
	diags, etc, using real money account is probably bettter because of more messed up data in
	paper trader, 

* Sun Apr 19 21:01:23 2009 rpc - There are unresolved issues in the ChartsControl.cpp
	in IB-CLR, that code doesn't work right because combo box not filled, 

* Sat Apr 18 11:05:22 2009 rpc - There is a source of FX historic data at
	http://www.alpari-idc.com/en/dc/databank.html 
* Tue Apr 14 16:27:23 2009 rpc - After fooling around with Tradelink for a day,
	once again, moving away from it, now my thought is to develop code that looks over
	historical data and gives me some metrics to use for making trading decisions, like
	different term trends, volatility, RSI, and others, but be able to get all the data at
	once, and look at it while looking at the chart, and trade dirctly in the IB interface,
	going to go back and look at IB-CLR again, did a lot of work there!, 

* Sun Apr 12 22:19:10 2009 rpc - Running Vista Eternity 2009 -
	Seems pretty cool so far.

	svn checkout http://tradelink.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tradelink-read-only


* Mon Feb 23 13:10:08 2009 rpc - Trading went well,
  Plan on starting for real MAYBE 3/10/09, if still doing well, have been focused on Seva and
	Futures, 

* Mon Jan 19 14:11:42 2009 rpc - Using the TBSP ASCII downloader,
  to get idx files, and lots of them are empty, 

* Fri Jan 16 14:00:30 2009 rpc - I have been doing trading,
  using desktop to view TOS charts and quotes, and use their facilities, and the laptop to
	enter paper trades at IB, first 2 cashed out winners, 2 riding over weekend right now,
	looking at TBSP index symbols,

* Mon Jan 05 05:58:11 2009 rpc - Using ticks, you could determine
  max drawdown, but using bars, how can you, because you don't know whether the low or the
	high cam first!, you can calculate a total range over some period, that could be used as a
	surrogate, 

* Sun Jan 04 17:43:23 2009 rpc - Working in NamedValarray file,
  MaxGainInPeriods(), this is for setting up the max gain in peroids and then the max draw
	down in periods, which will get written to OPtions3 Top100Extra table, so after setting up
	values, have to do something like uv101Row in * Mon Jan 05 06:03:29 2009 rpc - OR, use the
	NamedValarrays, and don't write to db, just recalculate when needed, 
	c:\data\cpp-projects\TradeFinder\UpVolatile101.cpp, whole thing kicks off in
	c:\data\cpp-projects\TradeFinder\TradeFinderControl.cpp ExplorationsButtonClicked(), 

* Sat Jan 03 15:11:43 2009 rpc - I think the way I'm already doing things is as good as
  anything I've seen so far, probably better approach, working on finding the big rises in
	price in the db of daily options data, and then where the draw down has been constrained,
	doing this in Stored Procs, 

* Fri Jan 02 06:13:28 2009 rpc - Exploring the Analysis Services, with
  their algorithms, in the SQL Server Business Intelligence Development environment, which is
	a Visual Studio Project type, the sample uses a decision tree algo, there is a times series
	algo, and a neural net algo, among others, If I look at the questions in "Data Mining
	Concepts (Analysis Services - Data Mining) " in the online help, I'm trying to find
  - Precursors to a sharp rise in price of a given option or other financial instrument,
  - I want a model that allows me to make predictions,
  - I need to insure that the data is clean and correct, and sufficient,
    - extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), is via Data Integration Services, 

* Mon Dec 29 12:30:55 2008 rpc - Have a ~\TOS-Code\ dir
  for code from TOS, which can be useful for finding trends, etc,.

  The idea is to look for a situation where the price has risen by 100% over the last 20
	periods, and has never degraded more than 10%, then find a 3 period pattern that occurs with
	the last of the 3 being the mark for the above rise, so, find the sell first, then find a
	buy setup, 

  For the life of me, I can't figure out how to set up a dataset, other than copying one or
	something like that, SqlServer just doesn't show up as a possible data provider!, So, you go
	about it backwards, install a SqlDataAdapter on a Form, then right click on it and say
	generate dataset, that does the job, 

* Sat Dec 27 05:19:34 2008 rpc - Rechecking the data in Top100Options,
  I didn't delete old rows before inserting new,
  In general, the data coming from TBSP has too many errors in it, most recently, the
	underlying name not being right, so, my feeling is, it is not dependable enough to use,

  There was also a problem earlier with IB data, so, if I can't get reliable data
	consistently, how can I automate the trading?, If I only am playing a limited number of
	symbols, I could keep track of them manually, but not the sort of automation I'm doing, it
	requires dependable data, 

* Fri Dec 26 11:50:28 2008 rpc - Installed the Quantlib and Boost libraries,
  This suggestion of Volatilities keeps coming up, not sure why, all of the windows in IB can
	be closed, which will probably aid performance, seeing as how JAva is such a problem, 

  Using client2.proj to get at the MArket Scanner stuff, project is in
	C:\data\cpp-projects\TWS-SocketClient\TestSocketClient, look for outFile in
	c:\data\cpp-projects\TWS-SocketClient\TestSocketClient\client2Dlg.cpp to find how I
	captured output for Historical Data, and now for scanner xml,

  If I fire the scanner with OPT_VOLUME_MOST_ACTIVE, STK, Above Price 40.00, Avg. Option Vol
	above 1000, Stock Type Filter = STOCK, then I get the biggest volume traders for the day,

  Need the tr_scanner_subscription_t for using the c api, 

* Wed Dec 24 16:35:03 2008 rpc - Turns out IB has a scan that scans for
  Option Volume, either the largest 50 ul's of the day, or "Hot by Option Volume" which is
	the largest vol last 10 days!, Just what I was doing with TBSP, pretty much!, they also
	have other interesting scans available, to do a scan go to Page/Create Market Scanner, set
	Instrument to US Stocks, then in Parameter, Hot By OPt Vol, man page is at
	http://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/tws/twsguide.htm search "Market Scanner
	Types", 

* Tue Dec 23 10:51:59 2008 rpc - The Trifecta,
  groups of 3's, 3 winners, 3 losers, 3 thoughts, 3 feelings, 3 x 6 is 18, an new password?,
	Is silliness inherent in the nature of things,?,
  The OCC has information memos regarding "Symbol Conversion" this is one of the reasons my
	options disappear at an early date, another is bad data coming from TBSP, regarding expiry,
	etc., so good data is hard to find!,

  Last valid date for below 4 is 7/17/08
	*VRNAF - *CAF
  *VGEMF - *GEWMD
  *VGEAG - *GEAG
  *JPMMD - *JSAMD

  Last valid date for below 4 is 12/8/08
  *BACMB - *BYOMJ
  *BACMC - *BYOMO
  *BACMS - *BYOMZ

    AAPL
    BAC
    C
    GE
    GM
    GS
    JPM
    MSFT
    PG
    WFC

  After all this analysis and so on, We've decided to just take the top ten stocks, by last
	months options volume, and construct a list of the 5 calls and 5 puts on either side of the
	current price, and build our top 100 options from that, then look at hourly charts and
	devise a trading plan based on that, this will avoid a lot of the wasted time, 

  


* Sun Dec 21 12:57:43 2008 rpc - After backup,
  shrink the OPtions3 DB,
  There are name changes going on, and duplicate options because of quarterlies, so the whole
	thing is a bigger mess than I thought, I am inclined to start looking at futures, 

* Sat Dec 20 13:39:45 2008 rpc - The new pattern SpikeDown in NamedVallary
  had to use a trim of the float to eliminate possibly suprious boolean tests, because 7th or
	8th decimal place may have some unpredictable value, see trimFloat() in NamedValarray,

  There is a desire to define TradeObjects deep in my soul, better do something about that,
	satisfy it!,

  (form)  ->WindowState = FormWindowState::Maximized;


* Fri Dec 19 11:39:06 2008 rpc - As I develop the trading system pattern recognition
  software, I find that primitives present themselves, so, in NamedValarray project, defining
	primitives that will be useful for pattern regonition,

  See notes-xemacs for changes made to make curly brace appear right after for() statement

* Thu Dec 18 09:32:40 2008 rpc - There is an easier softer way,
	and I'm going to take it, I'm first putting UpVolatile101 back to work, just as she is,
	perfect in her own strange way, THEN, creating a brand new TradeObject, called
	"SpikeyDown", these will both be listed in TradeFinder/Strategies,

	Some useful info from IB's Raymund, rchar671 iam4real
	First, you need to invoke ReqMktData(&) method in order to receive the current
	prices. These prices are delivered by TickPrice() automatically.

		ReqMktData(&)
		&.
		&..
		TickPrice(&)
		&.

		Secondly, once the current prices are accessible in the TickPrice event, include the prices
			within the conditional expression.

		&. 
		Askprice = CurrentAskPrice
		&.
		If Askprice > 10.00 and Askprice < 20.0
		&..
		.PlaceOrder(BUY)
		&
		&.
		Bidprice = CurrentBidPrice
		&
		If Bidprice < 10.00 or  Bidprice > 20.00 (corrected and to or)
		&.. 
		.PlaceOrder(SELL)

	For the Setting up of the 100 or so options to trade, I'm doing the big DB work on the
	desktop, identifying the 100 biggest traders from the TopTen stocks, and creating a table
	in OPtions3  to hold the rows, but for the everyday downloading, I'll do that on the
	laptop, ad just copy over the data when I backup to the desktop,

	To get the data from TBSP into C:\zips\TBSP-Data, ftp (using Fire-FTP in Firefox is easy), get the
	daily_options_BA data, unzip to C:\zips\TBSP-Data\unzipped, run
	c:\data\Scripts\InsertCSVsIntoDB.bat to put it in the DB (this depends on
	InsertCSVforEquityOptionsDailyDataWorking Stored PRocedure being in DB),
	Then run TopTenDailyOptionsFromWorking SP,
	Then run Top100OptionsFromTopTenDailyOptions SP - This will get key constraints if there
	are rows in TopTenDailyOptions that have already been inserted, 

	UpVolatile101 was never really completed, if it is appropriate to use in future, it needs
	a lot of work yet, 

	Working on SpikeyDown, what does it look like?

  Curious behavior of the std::slice, you define it with 3 params, a starting idx, a length,
	and a stride, the stride can be negative, in which case it reads the array sliced into
	backwards, but the idxs are backwards too, so the 5th element this case is 5 elements back,
	

* Wed Dec 17 07:06:02 2008 rpc - Looking for the elusive ToolTip
	Working on the ExplorationChart1 for the BreakoutRetestRise application of a TradeObject,
	just noticed that the first word, Breakout, isn't really being tested for!, what I'm doing
	currently is more like a "HighPointDropRise", rather than "BreakoutRetestRise",

	I have a perfect trading system,

	C:\WinFormsChartSamples\ChartTypes\FinancialCharts\Stock\FinancialChartType.cs has best
	examples of using Points in a loop ta attach values and tooltips,

	I'm loading new symbols into Top100Options, and looking for a more characteristic play, 

	


	

* Tue Dec 16 05:39:28 2008 rpc - Searching for the missing
	Valarrays, Found the issue, really pretty simple, regards reference semantics, the
	reference to the OptionPages vector was not a reference, but needed to be, so again, one
	missing "&" was the problem, here is the

	problem:  std::vector<OptionsPage> pgs = OptionsPages::Instance()->getPagesVec();
	solution: std::vector<OptionsPage>& pgs = OptionsPages::Instance()->getPagesVec();

	I had the right form in the initializtion for the OptionsPages, but didn't notice the
	difference!,

	Chart Features/Data Series/Using Labels - might be a way to label sellprice, etc alse,
	Chart Features/Data Series/Using Markers, ../../Smart Labels, ../../"Inserting Empty Points" is
	interesting,

	Chart Features/Chart Areas/Keyboard Zoom/Scroll Cursor
	Chart Features/Axes/Multiple Y Axis shows 3 Y axis being use, Setting Variable Labels, for
	dealing with too many labels down at the bottom,

	Chart Types/Point Charts/Point Charts is what I'll want for buy/sell points,

	Axes/Axes MArgins - allow empty space at beginning or end of series on chart display,

	chart1.ChartAreas["Default"].AxisY.Minimum = Double.NaN; re max min displayed values on axes
   chart1.ChartAreas["Default"].AxisY.Maximum = Double.NaN;

	When putting in a new series, the preview in the designer isn't available until the
	XValueType is set to DateTime (where appropriate),

	Redoing the logic in c:\data\cpp-projects\TradeFinder\BreakoutRetestRise.cpp
	CTS - counterTrendDropSetup - is supposed to be a %rise from a previous drop, e.g., a
	highest-close 18 periods ago of 21, then a lowest-close 5 periods ago of 5, making the
	drop 16, then you want X-%, say 30% rise off that lowest close, 30% of the 16 point drop,
	so (.3 * 16), that would be the setup,

	LEFT OFF in ChartsControl::DrawExploration1(), need to get the ToolTip right, 

* Mon Dec 15 14:09:34 2008 rpc - Have gone thorugh 3 hours of redoing what had been
	TradeObjects project, to TradeFinder project, because of some wierd resource error that I
	couldn't find, anywhere!, so, TradeFinder is the new trade finding app!, 

	Checkout Legend, Interactive in the chart sample, it could be useful,

	Even though I'm attaching the ValArrays the same in the TradeObject as I do in the
	initializtion, the ValArrays aren't there when I want them in the ChartControl, where do
	they go?, not attaching them the same, left off an "&", see
	"problem:  std::vector<OptionsPage>" above,  

* Sat Dec 13 10:49:34 2008 rpc - The Options2 DB is getting too big
	for my laptop to handle, so, after backing everything up today, I'm creating an Options3
	DB which will trim down a lot,
	Creating a new project, TradeObjects, that will create the daily trade entries, this can
	be run before openning, and another program can use the OrderTickets created to do the
	trades, this will be the Trading program, all of these will draw upon classes created in
	IB-CLR,

	I Have a Perfect Trading System,

* Fri Dec 12 12:59:32 2008 rpc - Subtlety is my best aspect,
	This world of options prices is very sensitive and fine grained,

	These awesome valarrays have ways of doing things that are pretty wild!, the
	AbsoluteDifference between a value and another value r spaces away, either forward or
	backward, is a 1-liner,     absDif.va = abs(close.va - close.va.shift(periods));
   from NamedVallaray.cpp, AbsDif,

	Looking at my conditions in UpVolatile101, CTS is "counterTrendDropSetup",
	buyprice is initially pretty low, its the llv + a % of the rise against the drop

	Discovered my data rows are out of order when running the TradeObject, not sorting by
	date, this is happening elsewhere also, corrected,

	TO DO - Check other tables for proper sorting - DONE

* Thu Dec 11 06:44:11 2008 rpc - I am imagining using the daily data for setting
	buy/sell signals and prices, but using the intraday data during testing to check on 
	the projected test prices got, for actual trading? immediate data, i.e. - market
	data would be well thought out,

	The idea I'm working on is having the buy prices set, and any sell prices set, as I go
	into the day, this means having profit targets for sell prices, and a range for buy
	prices,

	Continuing the development in NamedArrayDev, this is where the Technical Indicators,
	others and mine, will be built, all to work with the NamedValarray template class,
	actually spent a lot of time in ChartsControl, learning how to attach a series for Uv101,
	buyprice, sellprice, I'm redefining UpVolatile101 as BreakoutRetestRise, which was the
	original idea, 

* Tue Dec 09 05:14:16 2008 rpc - Purno Ham,
	Today I wil combine the daily and intraday prices into a common table, thus making it
	possible to use either form for trading, * Thu Dec 11 06:43:33 2008 rpc - decided to keep
	the tables seperate, and just link into them when needed,

	Exception thrown from UpVolatile101::setupValarrays() because in TopTenOptionsDaily some
	names had less than periods rows, put in check, 

	PossibleTrades for UpVolatile101 are looking great on daily data, so I'm going to rework
	some parts of it to see if I can make it cleaner, * Sat Dec 13 10:57:15 2008 rpc - not as
	good when the data are properly date-sorted, but still ok,

* Mon Dec 08 09:26:34 2008 rpc - I have a perfect trading system,
	I am healthy, I am strong, I am certain,

	There is some stuff not getting recorded here for sure, wouldn't hurt to make notes as I
	go back over IB-CLR after not using it for a little while, like
	TopTenDailyOptions loading, TopTenDailyNames is in
	c:\data\cpp-projects\IB-CLR\OptionsDBDataSet.xsd, and is a StoredProc that returns all
	distinct names in the TopTenDailyOPtions table, which changes membership quite often, 

* Sat Dec 06 09:36:57 2008 rpc - Backing up everything to 1Tera drive,
	should do this every week, dailies to Rick-Desktop when developing,
	Working in NamedArrayDev, 

* Fri Dec 05 06:13:31 2008 rpc - The ta-lib documentation leaves a lot to be
	desired, very sketchy, but have a rsi working, see doData1() in Program.cs in
	IB-CLR-Charts c# project,
	Left off in ChartControl.DrawChart(), for some reason the chart doesn't redraw with newly
	loaded data, 

* Thu Dec 04 10:51:41 2008 rpc - Working in c:\data\SQL-Queries\PeriodsRiseFunc.sql
	to determine the rise from any particular date for any given symbol, to identify possible
	entry dates,

	Ran a query to determine the number of TopTenDailyOptions had had an increase over 100%
	during their lifetime, and it was 44 out of 65!, note that the close on the day the rise
	began varied from 1cent to $68!, makes me wonder about my constraints,,,

	LEft off in c# app getting the RSI for table, open IB-CLR sln

* Tue Dec 02 06:27:51 2008 rpc - Moving on with the C++ charts,
	The I-Ching has come back into my consciousness, and the awareness that I have been
	foolish in my judgements regarding Gypsy Boots, who after all managed to put together
	quite a life from what I'm aware of!, and in general, people who are extremely outside of
	"cool", let alone acceptable!, so, with renewed humility, lets go for it!,

	Setting up the PriceVolumeChart:
	Using the Designer:
	- 2 ChartAreas, PriceChartArea and VolumeChartArea
	- PriceChartArea/Position is (0, 0, 75, 100), VolumeChartArea is (0, 75, 100, 25)
	- To get the labels to show up more frequently, VolumeChartArea/Axes/X axis, set
	IntervalOffsetType to Minutes, also the IntervalType to Minutes seemed to help,
	- The VolumeChartArea/Axes/X axis/LabelStyle/Format is set to "MM/dd/yy hh:mm", which I typed
	in myself, this is also where the Cursors are set up, by setting
	- VolumeChartArea/CursorX/IsUserEnabled = true, and IsUserSelectionEnabled, get the line cursor
	and selection stuff for free!, then in the
	- PriceChartAreas/AlignWithChartArea to the VolumeChartArea, and walla!, they are synched
	up Can also  set the CursorY if you want to, 
	- in Chart/PriceSeries/Tooltip, using the keywords available, and custom format for the date
	(X-axis), this is what I have; #VALX{MM/dd/yy hh:mm}\nH - #VALY1{C},  L - #VALY2{C}, O-
	#VALY3{C},  C - #VALY4{C}, the PriceSeries/ChartType is Candlestick, and the Yvalues are bound
	to DB columns, which have to be in the right order, h, l, o, c,
	- in VolumeSeries/Tooltip, #VALX{MM/dd/yy hh:mm}\n#VAL
	- to set candlestick colors, Red down, Black up PriceSeries/BackSecondaryColor = Red,
	PriceSeries/Color = Black, can also set a bordr color around the candlesticks,

	I'm creating a ChartControlForm that will allow the parameters of the chart to be set, by
	default, each chart will start up as a ChartControlForm, then proceed from there,

	LEFT OFF - in ChartsControl::DrawChartClicked, have StoredProc TopTenDailyHLOCVforName
	ready for chart, this may cause a problem if I draw a second chart, will the first chart
	get the second charts data? No, did a table copy, it's basically working, 
	
	

* Mon Dec 01 11:58:10 2008 rpc - I'm going to do the charts in C++,
	put them in IB-CLR, the ta-lib funcs work via a .net array, so they will be easy to
	integrate, also, in the "Microsoft Chart for Windows Sample Environment"/Working with
	Data/Formulas/Technical Price Indicators, there are samples for many of the financial
	formulas that show how to set them up, so, the only iterations that would be necessary
	would be the inserting of the valarrays into a Chart Series,

	Checking out .Net cross language usability, can I start a c# implemented class that lives
	in a c# project in the c++ ipmlemented IB-CLR?, YES!, I have a reference in TE to the
	class in c# project, and it starts fine, but did get an error because it had been disposed
	when I tried to restart it, need the handling of close event that is in ErrorWindow,
	So, I'm putting the ChartsControl class in c# project, and drive all the charts from
	there, can I get the DataSet pointers, etc, across the border the other way?, so that I
	can use data already in IB-CLR in the c# classes?, (changed this to do all c++, for
	simplicity), 

* Sat Nov 29 07:07:32 2008 rpc - Working on integrating the charts into IB-CLR,
	Also, integrating the ta-lib functionality to work in the charts, and be useful for
	selection of buy and sell signals, download the latest top100 options, 15mins bars, I have
	their daily data already

	I'm not sure where MS hid the way to add controls to the toolbox!, 

* Fri Nov 28 11:16:25 2008 rpc - I'm going to work on the TradeObject
	interface, particularly the NamedValarray collection, upgrade it to do a lot more, it is
	the same as what is called the "timeseries" class in Quantlib, but that class is vector
	based, there seems to be some agreement with my assessment of Valarray as a superior
	class,

	I've put a link to the ta-lib library in IB-CLR, and it is using a different .dll than the
	one in the C:\ta-lib-0.4.0-msvc\dotnet\src\Debug dir because of settings in the Link, its
	using the same lib in C:\data\cpp-projects\IB-CLR\Debug, so 2 copies, but the same source
	code,


	To get the .Net to work with ta-lib, you have to use managed arrays, speedily convert from
	valarray to managed arrays?, is that possible?, Looks like a member by member copy is
	necessary, but I can use the Database rows via a select, which actually return cli arrays,
	I think,

	LEFT OFF the TopTenOptionsDaily has the latest and greatest 100 options, so can create a
	chart to look at them in various ways, and get the intraday data for them, 

* Thu Nov 27 18:19:13 2008 rpc - The project
	C:\data\csharp-projects\ChartExample1\BuyPriceSellPrice1 is a chart that maps buy and sell
	price over the candlestick of 15min bars, and volume, using Sql ServerDB,
	Have downloaded ta-lib C:\ta-lib-0.4.0-msvc\dotnet\src, which is all C source, compiled
	into .Net dll with 0 trouble, next step is to define the conditions that give a buy and
	sell price, then design the system that buys if the buy price hits set buyprice, set from
	previous bar, and sells when an open position hits a sell price, 

* Tue Nov 25 12:14:02 2008 rpc - Have installed a csharp-mode, see init.el
	I need to start keeping track of the complexities in the Chart properties, functions,
	etc., 
	- To get the labels to show up more frequently, ChartAreas/Axes/X axis, set
	IntervalOffsetType to Minutes, also the IntervalType to Minutes seemed to help,
	- The ChartAreas/Axes/X axis/LabelStyle/Format is set to "MM/dd/yy hh:mm", which I typed
	in myself, this is also where the Cursors are set up, by setting
	ChartAreas/CursorX/IsUserEnabled = true, and IsUserSelectionEnabled, get the line cursor
	and selection stuff for free!, then in the ChartAreas/Volume, set its AlignWithChartArea
	to the Price Area, and walla!, they are synched up Can also set the CursorY if you want
	to, 
	- in Chart/Series/Tooltip, using the keywords available, and custom format for the date
	(X-axis), this is what I have; #VALX{MM/dd/yy hh:mm}\nH - #VALY1{C},  L - #VALY2{C}, O-
	#VALY3{C},  C - #VALY4{C}, the series/charttype is Candlestick, and the Yvalues are bound
	to DB columns, which have to be in the right order, h, l, o, c, 

* Mon Nov 24 06:25:40 2008 rpc - After looking at TradeLink, I am back to
	IB-CLR, this idea of mkts changing, of magic afoot, of the influence of South America, the
	Kundalini of the Earth in Chile, The Tabla is back in my consciousness, music via the
	Drum, There is a new Chart object available that may work with SqlServer well, and also,
	SS v8 developer is only $50!,

	Working with the new Chart control, pretty cool!,
	Date, high, low, open, close seems to be the expected order for the series, 

* Sat Nov 22 08:29:20 2008 rpc - Have begin working on TradeLink,
	Helped with a problem in th C++ code for linking to TWS, the old eClientSocket class
	needed to be built anew to make it work ok,
	Looking at an example from the online tutorial, here are some corrections for
	CourseIntroApplets, http://code.google.com/p/tradelink/wiki/CourseIntroApplets,

	1 - couple of places, misspelled "poslist" as "postlist" (Position Dictionary)

	2 - no copy constructor for Position class  (I'll write and submit if you like)
	    Position old = new Position(poslist[trade.symbol]);  fails. I used
     	Position old = new Position(poslist[trade.symbol].ToTrade()); doesn't do a full copy,
	   but probably good enough for this

	3 - decimal offsetby = OFFSETAMOUNT * (current.ToTrade().Side ? 1 : -1); replaces
		 decimal offsetby  = OFFSETAMOUNT * (current.Side ? 1 : -1);

	4 - Order offset = new LimitOrder(trade.symbol, !current.Side, offsetprice, offsetsize);
		trade is not in scope, and Side is member of Trade, not Position,
		offsetprice, offsetsize are in wrong argument order and offsetsize needs to be int, not
		decimal, changed line is
		Order offset = new LimitOrder(current.Symbol, current.ToTrade().Side, offsetsize, offsetprice);

		



* Thu Nov 20 12:56:37 2008 rpc - Looking at TradeLink,
	which means downloading svn  from collabNet to get it, and doing some C# learning, 

* Tue Nov 18 09:29:30 2008 rpc - I just realized that
	tables can be created from other tables by using the "into" operator, and that is what I
	have done, to create table tempido, which is temp IntradayOptions, that has buy and sell
	columns, and this can be used to load into AmiBroker, a line of buy/sell signals from
	PossibleTrades, so that I can see where they are happening,

	There is this idea of, "connecting the dots", letting each close be a dot, and measure the
	distance of all the dots from point A to point B, this will give a, "distance", that tells
	you how much fluctuation was in the path,

	Any array operation in Amibroker is easy to duplicate in the database, just create a new
	table with calculated rows, this doesn't take care of Ref(array, periods);, or any other
	that involves lookbacks, how to do those?, 

* Mon Nov 17 16:33:01 2008 rpc - Another TE initialization failure,
	this one due to not putting the intial row in the order table after deleting all its rows,
	which causes a fault when the OrderWindow is created, from TE, should I put exception
	handling code all over the place?, no, not now,

	LEft Off - have created PossibleTradesParamsUv101 table, to store params that were
	involved in a given PossibleTrades construct, need to add a row for each call to
	CreatePossibleTrades, 

* Sat Nov 15 16:41:50 2008 rpc - Note that running the 15min
	data using 80 instead of 20 for periods, gave a small, 2-3%, positive result, also, in
	Amibroker, the results were very positive for 1 hour bars, but negative for 15 min bars,

	In Amibroker afl, working on a new paradigm that uses direction, momentum, and fluctuation
	(variability over time, i.e., - volatility), this is in
	c:\data\AmiBroker\Formulas\Systems\MomentumDirectionVolatility\

	One thought is down volatility, increasing upward direction, and increasing momentum =
	buy, increasing volatility, increasing downward direction, and falling momentum = sell, 

* Fri Nov 14 07:04:46 2008 rpc - How do I Set the buyprice and sellprice?
	Getting the type initialization exception on startup again, re TE,
	START SQL SERVER!!!
	

* Thu Nov 13 13:03:48 2008 rpc - Now I'm going to develop a new
	TradeObject, called, BottomSeeking, to reflect the current mkt,

	HOW TO: get data from sql into Amibroker,

	1 - for all intraday and the 5 sec "realtime" bars from IB, use RTOptionsForAmi.sql and
	save results in csv file and use IntradaySqlServer.format in Ami
	2 - for the daily options data in TopTenOptionsDaily table, use
	TopTenOptionsDailyForAmi.sql and save result in csv file, and use "SQL Server
	DailyOptions" as import type

* Thu Nov 13 12:42:47 2008 rpc - Here is how to setup the
	daily data from TPSP
	1 - download the zips into C:\zips\TBSP-Data
	2 - unzip them into C:\zips\TBSP-Data\unzipped
	3 - run c:\data\Scripts>insertcsvsintoDB.bat - this puts data in db in
	EquityOptionsDailyDataWorking table

* Wed Nov 12 11:22:54 2008 rpc - It is fine to use
	AmiBroker, when the mkt changes, and a new paradign is needed for finding winners, charts
	are useful, 

* Mon Nov 10 05:15:54 2008 rpc - To use the NamedValArrays,
	the way that seems to make the most sense in the TradeObject,
	- A function that sets up all the valarrays, in upVolatile101,
	= A RealTime PossibleTrades table, that has longs instead of DateTimes, for entry date,
	etc.,

	The realtime (actually 5 sec bars), doesn't yield any trades, it's in and out too fast,
	going back to the 15mins bars, 

	NOTE: Once we have a TableAdapter, the table doesn't need to be instantiated ('new'ed'),
	see ControlForm::LoadIntradayDataRT() where the
	TE::rtAdapter->Fill(TE::ODBDataSet->IntraDayOptionsRT); is sufficient to fill a table that
	is accessible,

	You must connect to IB before setting up Options, in order to have the BaseTickerID set
	properly!, I put a warning MessageBox in the relevant OPtionsPages funcs,

	HOW TO: use the daily options data from TBSP to setup the most active options table
	1 - Setup CurrentlyActiveLocalSymbols table using CurrentlyActiveLocalSymbols.sql
	2 - Setup the TopTenOptionsDaily table with SetupWorkingTableWithDataForIB.sql not that
	this uses EquityOptionsDailyDataWorking table as an intermediary, and it gets deleted
	before this runs (this could be not done), 

	Left off in SetupWorkingTableWithDataForIB.sql, delete from TopTenOptions, then populate
	it with last statement in SetupWorkingTableWithDataForIB.sql, 

* Thu Nov 06 15:09:21 2008 rpc - The dataAdapter and table
	for the realtime data is set up to be used in TE, this lets all classes work on the same
	table,

	right now, event_realtime_bar() handles putting the data in db and updating db every row,
	might want to redo that, set the update to happen less frequently,

	To do backtesting on realtime, need to create calls similar to the LoadHistoricDataFromDB,
	LoadOptionsPagesQuotesData, and RunATradeObjectClicked, all in ControlForm.cpp

	There is a snag with the datetime vals, which are relevant to the upVolatile, and used in
	some other ways, but the dates are coming into realtime in a long that is the number of
	seconds since 1/1/1970 GMT, so need some new datetime funcs, here is some stuff from MSDN
	that could be helpful,
	DateTime(1970, 1, 1).ToLocalTime() + long in which is number of seconds since that date,

	System::DateTime dTime(1970, 1, 1);
	System::DateTime rTime = dTime.ToLocalTime();
	// tSpan is 0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes and 1000 second.
	System::TimeSpan tSpan(0, 0, 0, 1000 );
	System::DateTime result = rTime + tSpan;

* Tue Nov 04 18:24:19 2008 rpc - Left off in
	OptionsPages::setupCurrentlyActiveOptionsWithID()

* Tue Nov 04 11:38:08 2008 rpc - I am going to create a class that is a global interface
	for the table that will hold the realtime bars, and try this for real time trading, this
	will make the buy price much more realistic, to use as a multiplier for evenly
	cash-balanced trades, All that is necessary for this is to put the DataSet in TE, and use
	the tables residing there for all relevant ops, actually, this is all that is necessary
	for sharing tables across the board, 

	Check the orderId returned by event_order_status(), does it agree with what you sent?,

	IB and Java are really memory horrible, Java ran out of heap space, and the whole system
	started to crawl, this after just a few windows in the Java interface, 

	Using the RealTime data for trading, as it is the only call that needs to be made for
	both buy and sell, requires some changes to the app and new approaches to some of the
	processing,

	1 - Creating CurrentlyActiveOptionsWithID table in Options2, which will be a 0 based list,
	and used to create the OptionsPages, this way, the id passed in via realtime bars will be
	used directly, save time and resources, and stored in the database, use a cross join to
	get the name of an option in DB ops, because OPtionsPages vector, optionsPagesVec, is
	intialized to 1000 elements in OptionsPages::Instance (), using these arbitrary idxs for
	inserts will work,
	2 - request for realtime only needs to happen once, and then here comes the data
	continuously, is it more sensible to just add to the valarrays, rather than recreating
	them everytime? Regarding valarrays, what about creating them all with enough space to
	hold a days worth of data, since realtime bars are 5 seconds, that would be 4680 for a 6.5
	hr. trading day, 5000 would be a good number, so 5000 * about 12 * about 100 is 6 million,
	so, gobble up about 60-100 megs of memory,
	3 - The realtime table is going to be in TE, and thus accessible from any class that knows
	TE, adapters can be set up when needed where needed,
	4 - NamedValArray has a new function to allow a positionedInsert, which should make
	everything easier in the TradeObject,


* Mon Nov 03 09:20:09 2008 rpc - The 15 min bars are accurate
	for 10/31, and Ray from IB called to tell me that a transfer of data was complete, still
	need to check the immediate date for accuracy, will do that today, also, get the
	OrderTicket stuff down,
	also look at ToolTips, would be nice for accuracy,

	Got past this below by setting many values in Order struct in OrderWindow::sendOrder()
	Error: 321 Error validating request:-'sb' : cause - Cannot set VOL attribute on non-VOL
	order.

	Return from event_order_status() for a buy of 1 C-10.0000-200812-P, this has to get back
	to the OrderWindow to update the order.
		perm_id	1866516858	int
		order_id	99	int
		avg_fill_price	0.55000000000000004	double
		client_id	1	int

		parent_id	0	int
		remaining	0	int
+		status	0x0A7B01B8 "Filled"	char*

	There is a problem with the optionsPagesVec[idx], it's getting called with idx's outside
	of its boundry, believe I took care of it, the function optionNameByID() is only currently
	being called from HistoricalDataInserter::InsertHistoricalQuotes(), and that's where the
	problem is, wasn't taking the nextValidId into account,

	Below somewhere is how to go from System::String to ansi, here is going the other way:
	    String ^ statusOut = Marshal::PtrToStringAnsi((IntPtr) (char *) status); (status is
	ansi string)

	The delegate thing is very convoluted. These are steps that need to happen:
	1 - define a delegate, e.g.,     delegate void NewHistoricalDataDelegate(String^ strIn);
	2 - get an instance of the delegate, e.g., NewHistoricalDataDelegate^ NewHistoricalDataDelegater;
	3 - Create the instance, passing in the function its going to delegate, e.g.,
	    NewHistoricalDataDelegater = gcnew NewHistoricalDataDelegate( this, &OrderWindow::NewHistoricalData);
	4 - In the fucntion, check to see if the delegater is needed, if not, do what it does, if
	so, I believe the delegator just ends up calling the function thread safe. E.g.,
	  public: System::Void NewHistoricalData(String^ strIn)
          {
            if(this->InvokeRequired)
            {
              this->Invoke(this->NewHistoricalDataDelegater, strIn);
            }
            else
            {
              HandleNewHistoricalData(strIn);
            }
          }




* Sat Nov 01 15:26:28 2008 rpc - The Orders have to wait for IB to be active,
	looking again at Data validity, communication with IB API guy established,

	Since the intraday data from IB is so suspect, creating a table of daily data to parse in
	IB-CLR, called TopTenOptionsDaily, this can be processed by the TradeObject,
	UpVolatile101, 

* Fri Oct 31 12:21:37 2008 rpc - Beginning work on the order entries for the initial
	orders generated by Possible Trades,

	Running into problems with the Order struct, so many values interacting there!,
	For using max values for ints, see
	c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include\limits.h
	for max values for doubles and floats, see
	c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include\float.h


* Thu Oct 30 14:39:51 2008 rpc - After flirting heavily with TradeStation,
	back to my development, the TS flirtation sort of died when I read some reviews on Elite
	Trader, seems they have some very serious problems, the data problem in IB is hopefully
	solvable!, aside from dat problems, the API is way limited from what I can gather, the
	sort of filtering I'm doing now for options would be hard at best, impossible at worst,
	remember this the next time IB disappoints a little bit, 

	Working on the PossibleTrades, using it to initialize the OrderTickets table, this may not be
	appropriate in some situations, where the orders are already up to date, left off in
	OrderWindow::doIntialTrades() 

* Mon Oct 27 05:04:19 2008 rpc - I'm working in the DB, getting the 10 largest volume
	ULs, first getting rid of the idxs, which have the very highest volume,

	On to the app, Going to try using RealTime bars, see if that helps the data situation,

	Saving the Select string from IB-CLR for IntradayHistoricHiVol in Sql-Queries dir, this is
	trying to get around this 0 vol problem, which because of bad data, should probably be
	ignored, and if I keep only the relevant data in the IntraDayOptions table, i.e., the ones
	for the currently active options, then I don't need the fancier select pharase, 

* Fri Oct 24 10:13:58 2008 rpc - Running it, make sure IB-CLR works...
	It works after changing the DB. There was an exception thrown during TE initialization
	which had to do with an incorrect DB table mapping in OrderTickets, because of a schema
	change, corrected.

	Spent the day trying to understand this issue with OrderTickets, ended up creating a whole
	new DataTable in DataSet, and getting rid of old one, the whole DB connectivity thing
	could be done very simply, but the IDE does make it easier for the most part,

* Thu Oct 23 06:36:14 2008 rpc - ThinkOrSwim is a bust because
	trades are too expensive, and it doesn't have a programmable interface,

	Changed  from 100 to 1000 -> pinstance->optionsPagesVec.reserve(1000), because the
	OptionsPagesBySymbol was failing (again), this is a real bugger, 

	There is an issue with the OrderID, I'm going to have to use a unique ID, not the one for
	the OptionPage, because of the way TWS is, so, I'm starting them at 1000, assuming I won't
	use any id's that high for anything else, and each order will have a unique id, also,
	creating a row, see OrderTableBaseIdHolderRowCreate.sql, that holds the value 1000 for
	orderId, [name] is BaseIdHolder, 

* Wed Oct 22 11:03:43 2008 rpc - TradeStation is a bust because
	it cost too much and everything has to be written in EasyLanguage, and there is no way to
	take a break without having to shell out the money every month, also, sounds like it has
	very serious issues with data lockups and crashes, 

* Tue Oct 21 14:41:57 2008 rpc - I'm going ahead with the IB
	development, in spite of possible problems with data,
	Working in the OrderWindow,
	private: System::Void handleSellSignal(ystem::String^ symbolName, BuySellData& bsd);
	and its counterpart
	for buy signal,
	1 - need to send off an order for buy,
	2 - first ticket is sent in and PendingSubmit is set by me, not TWS, TWS returns an Order
	Status, see below, and that can be set by me in the OrderTcket state field, 

	for sell signal,
	1 - determine that sell signal is appropriate, i.e., there is an open position in my portfolio,
	2 - need to send off order to sell,
	3 - first ticket is sent in and PendingSubmit is set by me, not TWS, TWS returns an Order
	Status, see below, and that can be set by me in the OrderTcket state field, same as buy, 

	So, a closed trade will have matched tickets, for buy and sell,
	for Order Ticket row creation, only 3 fields are absolutely required,
	INSERT INTO [Options2].[dbo].[OrderTickets] 	([name], [origindate], [lmtPrice])

	Off to see what happens when an order is entered, which among other possibilities returns
	via

  The order status. Possible values include:

	PendingSubmit - you have transmitted the order, but have not yet received confirmation
	that it has been accepted by the order destination. NOTE: This order status is not sent by
	TWS and should be explicitly set by the API developer when an order is submitted.

	PendingCancel - you have sent a request to cancel the order but have not yet received cancel
	confirmation from the order destination. At this point, your order is not confirmed
	canceled. You may still receive an execution while your cancellation request is
	pending. NOTE: This order status is not sent by TWS and should be explicitly set by the
	API developer when an order is canceled.

   PreSubmitted - a simulated order type has been accepted by the IB system and that this
	order has yet to be elected. The order is held in the IB system until the election
	criteria are met. At that time the order is transmitted to the order destination as
	specified.

   Submitted - your order has been accepted at the order destination and is working.

   Cancelled - the balance of your order has been confirmed canceled by the IB system. This
	could occur unexpectedly when IB or the destination has rejected your order.

   Filled - the order has been completely filled.

   Inactive - the order has been accepted by the system (simulated orders) or an exchange
	(native orders) but that currently the order is inactive due to sytem, exchange or other
	issues.

   ApiPending - the order has been reported to TWS by the API using reqAllOpenOrders() or reqOpenOrders().

   ApiCancelled - the order reported by the API has been cancelled.



* Mon Oct 20 11:53:34 2008 rpc - The Historical Data from IB
	is proving to be unreliable, hopefully a temporary and small problem, if its not a small
	temporary problem I will have to rethink how I am going to trade, today I'm doing a
	comparison of data for the past week of the active options to see how bad it is,

	The problem with historical data has brought me to a halt, also, the skinny on IBs fills,
	which has some bad web entries, and fits my own eval, hope that tradestation isn't a bust,
	

* Fri Oct 17 06:58:40 2008 rpc - The OrderWindow::GenerateOrders() could
	return a value from the uv101->getTrades(symbolName), that is the trade suggestion, this
	could be in a new struct that holds only info releative to the trades needing to be made,
	see BuySellData struct in c:\data\cpp-projects\IB-CLR\TradeObject.h, 

* Thu Oct 16 04:10:34 2008 rpc - Today I'm working in the
	UpVolatile101::getTrades(System::String ^symbolName), which needs to setup the valarrays,
	the valarrays need work to function better in this context, since the length of the Quotes
	data should be the length of the valarrays, checking that should be easy, and resizing the
	valarrays should be easy,

	I'm once again having to convert to a std::string from a System::String, this requires
	marshalling, like so,
	   str = dr["name"]->ToString(); //A System::String
      char* cStr = (char*)(void*)Marshal::StringToHGlobalAnsi(str); 
      opPtr = OptionsPages::Instance()->getByTicker(cStr);
      Marshal::FreeHGlobal(IntPtr(cStr));
 

* Wed Oct 15 11:48:34 2008 rpc - The code that gets me into the trading loop
	is sketched out, there is a BackgroundWorker thread, see OrderWindow::GenerateOrders()
	which actually does the work, the idea is it gets the symbol that has a new historical
	data, and calls the TradObject, UpVolatile101, uv101->getTrades(symbolName), to get the
	trades buy or sell, once the trades are gotten, it has to swack the OrderTickets to the
	internet, via a call to the TWS interface, knowing which orders to actually send in has to
	do with what is already active, if we want to avoid buying the same symbol more than once,
	and also, what to sell, we have to know what is already bought, so where does this
	happen?, 

* Tue Oct 14 10:39:55 2008 rpc - I don't need to do possible trades for the
	Actual trading cycle, only need buy and sell signals for the last period, attaching the
	TradeObject to the OrdersWindow sort of makes sense, then a signal can be sent to it with
	just the name of the option to buy or sell, and the OrdersWindow can take care of the
	rest, it needs to know a price to setup a multilpier, or again, that could be done in the
	TradeObject, I've found the way to do a good timer, see Timer1.h and cpp, 

* Mon Oct 13 07:14:10 2008 rpc - I am nearing the integration of Selfhood,
	this will complete my being, this will enchant the world with its essence, this is my
	purpose, what does this mean?, It means there are no others, there is only Self, so
	instead of a "neighborhood" I have a Selfhood, instead of neighbors, I have Self appearing
	as other people and things, this becomes integrated, working together perfectly, this will
	complete my being, this is my true purpose, to enable this happening,

	InsertHistoricalQuotes can be expanded to do the all the work required to launch into the
	TradeObject, Then the TradeObject can run in an independent thread,

	Errors again in the Designer, when I changed the name of the class from TradeWindow to
	OrderWindow, it loaded ok again, So, there are a few places where the TradeWindow is the
	OrderWindow, is the TradeWindow...,

* Thu Oct 09 12:10:47 2008 rpc - The code that is in
	ControlForm::LoadOptionsPagesQuotesData() is needed in trade loop, and the checking of the
	latest date is done in the HistoricalDataInserter::InsertHistoricalQuotes(), which will be
	necessary in trade loop, 

* Tue Oct 07 06:43:16 2008 rpc - Staying centered in the Self is the most important
	task, I am renaming Globals TE, for transcendental historical reasons, that part of you
	that wants to get on it, that's the kundalini shakti,

	LEFT OFF: in c:\data\cpp-projects\IB-CLR\UpVolatile101Trading.cpp, just pretty much put
	code in that could be useful, more design needed, decided not to have an inital run
	followed by a trading loop, because it would obviously cause some performance problems,
	basically, the pump has to be primed up to the current time, and then the loop can be
	started, could use the InitialTicketsFromPossibleTrades stored proc to setup the first
	tickets, then the InitialLoadOptionsPagesQuotesData() in
	c:\data\cpp-projects\IB-CLR\UpVolatile101Trading.cpp wouldn't be needed, assuming the
	ControlForm::LoadOptionsPagesQuotesData() had been used, need a lot more clarity around
	this, 

* Mon Oct 06 06:46:51 2008 rpc - Globals Object is going to play a big part,
	because the Forms are spun in their own thread, so get multithreading free, using the
	delgates as is done in ErrorWindow allows sharing of data, see writeToTextBox() in
	c:\data\cpp-projects\IB-CLR\ErrorWindow.h, will this allow the passing of the
	TableAdapter?,

	New Function, ControlForm::InitiateTrading(), idea is to spin a thread as for historical
	testing, but have 2 sets of 2-parameters, duration and barsize strings, cooresponding to
	initial duration, then running duration, these get passed via the threadproc, which really
	is just to spin a new thread, to OptionsPages::requestCurrentHistoricalData(),

	

* Mon Oct 06 05:46:41 2008 rpc - Here is what happens with the Historical Data coming in -
	1 - event_historical_data() in c:\data\cpp-projects\IB-CLR\TwsCallsFrom.cpp sends a vector
	of data to HistoricalDataInserter::Instance()->InsertHistoricalQuotes(hdVec);
	the size of this vector is determined in call to
	UpdateHistDataThread(DurationTextBox->Text, barsizeTextBox->Text, twsInst); coming from
	ControlForm::OptionsPagesHistoricalDataUpdate in
	c:\data\cpp-projects\IB-CLR\ControlForm.cpp  initiated by button click,

	2 - HistoricalDataInserter::Instance()->InsertHistoricalQuotes(hdVec) checks to insert
	only new datarows, the table being inserted into is IntraDayHistoricHiVol, which like all
	tables, is in the OPtionsDBDataSet, remember that instances of that have to be shared to
	have the same values, or the table has to be updated and loaded each time to make sure it
	is in synch with other instances,

	3 - After all of the OPtions rows are updated with latest quotes data, another button push
	sets up the ValArrays that attach the quotes data to the OPtionsPages, and are used in the
	TradeObject, currently UpVolatile101, which finds the possible trades,

	So, given this sequence of events that works well for doing the historical backtesting,
	where do I change things for the actual realtime trading?,

	1 - after the initial data from days past is collected, need only 1 days worth of data to
	be collected in HistoricalDataInserter::Instance()->InsertHistoricalQuotes(hdVec), this is
	controlled by the call to UpdateHistDataThread coming from ControlForm,

	2 - The HistoricalDataInserter::Instance()->InsertHistoricalQuotes(hdVec) could call
	another class to do the setting up of all the valarrays, and the finding of most recent
	trades, this could be consolidated, currently for Historical testing, it is happening in 2
	different places, the quotes valarrays are being built in
	ControlForm::LoadOptionsPagesQuotesData(), and the rest of the valarrays are being built
	in UpVolatile101::setupValarrays(),

	3 - the UpVolatile101::findPossibleTrades() is building the possibleTradesTable, as soon
	as this is built for a given option, the TradeWindow needs to be notified so it can build
	and send the necessary Order Tickets, 

* Sun Oct 05 10:16:33 2008 rpc - During my reading this morning,
	it occured to me, to use the 15 min historical data for the trading cycle, I could just
	load that, into a different table, a 15 min table, and preserve the 1hr data for posterity
	testing, could also test the daily, older historical that was saved, etc., that gives me a
	large body of, "out of bandwidth", data to test on,

	For doing the latest biggest options, I'm checking only the past week's largest, and also
	checking that the min ulclose is at least 15, see
	CurrentlyActiveOptionsListCreated100308.sql, 

* Sat Oct 04 15:14:22 2008 rpc - Back on the Laptop!,
	A weekend ritual is to download the TBSP data and check for the latest biggies, 

* Fri Oct 03 11:15:29 2008 rpc - The laptop is almost running again,
	for the past few days dev has been here on the desktop, good ol 8250!,
	OptionsPages::requestMarketData(void *twsInst), is start of trade cylce, let's see if it
	causes trouble when many symbols are requested, * Sun Oct 05 17:10:58 2008 rpc - changing
	this to use 15 min historical, 

* Thu Oct 02 04:58:08 2008 rpc - See Sat Sep 27 -, gettting back to the tasks at hand,
	the trading itself is done, I'm filling in the missing pieces here, I can rewrite the
	buy/sell/sellprice/buyprice routines in UpVolatile101 TradeObject to deal with just the
	last price, leave out considerations of open/high/close, as I'm working in real mkt time
	during trading hours, (* Sun Oct 05 17:11:52 2008 rpc - changing this to 15min historical
	bars), 

	A DataError from the DataGridViewComboBox control in the Orders state column was because
	the length of the data was different, even though the text was the same, set the length to
	as defined in the DB, 

	Moving on the trade-cycle, this starts with a message from the reqMktData tickprice
	response, which is sent to a TradeObject, processed, then new trades sent to the
	TradeWindow, which takes care of the Order Tickets, then there is sending the trade in, an
	OrderWindow might do that,
	OptionsPages sends the requests for market data in, 


* Wed Oct 01 10:25:00 2008 rpc - The GridView is bound through a BindingSource,
	which can have a filter set to the "where" clause, now I'm looking at creating a
	UserControl that gives me something that can be used for each tab in the TradeWindow that
	involves OrderTickets, remember to setup the Considering Orders with the PossibleTrades
	that are most current using the StoredProc in the DataSet, this will happen in the
	initialization of the trading system, after the historical data is taken care of,

	I'm starting over with TradeWindow, it is just going to be OrderTickets, and filter
	settings, moving the PossibleTrades to a filter for that already existing page/window,
	there is also the, "current price", "execution time", "order submission time", and maybe
	some others that need to be available during trading time,   

* Tue Sep 30 11:31:24 2008 rpc - I'm checking to see about binding a GridView to
	a select with params, (see above, this is done via filter in the BindingSource,

	1zw7x3240240898812 PC Progress UPS


* Mon Sep 29 12:16:50 2008 rpc - The beginning of the end here, we hope,
	getting the trading interface to work will complete the initial task, then the trading
	itself remains, what is this about?,

* Sat Sep 27 11:40:54 2008 rpc - I need to check and see if there is any limit on the number
	of symbols per time for MktData, like there is for historical data, in IB. There doesn't
	appear to be a similar limit,
	2a - here is what I can do in UpVolatile101.cpp, attach all the valarrays to the options
	pages, and only run through the calculation for the new value, which can be the last price
	coming from a ReqMktData, this can be sent directly to UpVolatile from the
	event_tick_price(), UpVolatile enters that as a close and an open for the next period, the
	calculations currently for historical prices use the hi and lo too, (see Thu Oct 02), 

	LEFT OFF - need to define an entry point in UpVolatile101 that is for the realtime
	trading, the arrays are attached to the OptionsPages, so the calculations that are just
	for the incoming (last price) signal, can use those to set up the PossibleTrades and the
	rest, also, the arrays should be updated, these arrays are not persisted in the DB, but
	the Possible Trades are,
	SEE c:\data\SQL-Queries\InitialOrderTicketsFromLatestPossibleBuys.sql, and its header
	note, there is an OrderTickets table in the app, and InitialTicketsFromPossibleTrades
	stored proc can be invoked there, to setup the initial order tickets, then there is the
	sell side, after postions are created, can have a positions table, and send sell orders to
	it, 

* Fri Sep 26 10:40:47 2008 rpc - I already have a ControlForm,
	so, from there, I can launch seperate threads to do the necessary steps to trading,
`	1 -
	initialize - setup the TradeWindow with the trades from the initializing run of the
	TradeObject, this will give the most recent trades available, the process of determining
	which options to make available for trading has to be established before initialization,
	this would be a place to use the TBSP data, so the "Populate Options Pages From New
	Current List" button can be pushed, that setup happens outside of the Trading app it is
	the historical load app, if the database already holds the latest quotes, there is no need
	to do "Option Pages Historical Data Update"(the historical load app), but if that's the
	case, then "CheckInLatestIntradayOptions" should be a subset, possible all of, the New
	Current List of options, once the initializtion is done, it is time to run the constant
	loop,

	2 - The Constant Loop - , as each options latest data comes in, it is immediately
	processed by the TradeObject, and necessary trades, both buy and sell, are sent to the
	TradeWindow, there needs to be an awareness here of currently active trades in the
	TradeObject, it needs to work closely with the TradeWindow, also, it is probably a good
	idea to use MarketData,

	

* Thu Sep 25 05:22:48 2008 rpc - I have to have a mind towards automation as
	I construct the TradeWindow, though I want control, to be able to intervene, I want
	automation for normal operation, so, do I need a current Possible Trades window, or should
	that go immediately to an order ticket?, 

* Wed Sep 24 06:15:57 2008 rpc - Now we are on to creating the TradeWindow,
	which will institute the actual trades with IB, in the Options2 DB (SqlServer), the
	PossibleTrades table can be used to construct OrderTickets, this is good for the buy
	phase, what about the sell?, 

* Tue Sep 23 17:08:18 2008 rpc - 	Looks like
	we need a way to patch into the historical update, without breaking the place we are in
	the queue, to deal with network breaks, very inconsistent behavior from the DSL
	connection, and the same is true, but less often!, from the satellite connection,

* Tue Sep 23 07:26:10 2008 rpc - After getting the update error fixed, ran Uv101,
	and found all the data was the same for all the symbols!, Had forgotten to increment a
	counter in a for loop, it was set to 0 for every  iteration, today I will go on and test
	the code, see if we get + results, later - results are very positive!,
	Fixed - c:\data\cpp-projects\IB-CLR\ControlForm.cpp
	ControlForm::LoadOptionsPagesQuotesData(), in the Select string, was opes[0], changed to
	opes[i], opes is a vector of OPtionsPages being set up with quotes data, 

	

* Sun Sep 21 18:16:09 2008 rpc - I have run an update for 30 min, then had it come back with an error code,
	if this is the case, I need to force an update of DB with records already gathered, and
	get the name of the offending option,
	Error that causes the problem:
	Error: 200  No security definition has been found for the request
	Fixed - see c:\data\cpp-projects\IB-CLR\OptionsPages.h bool OptionsPages::error200break,
	which is set in c:\data\cpp-projects\IB-CLR\TwsCallsFrom.cpp event_error(), and used in
	OptionsPages::requestCurrentHistoricalData(),


* Sun Sep 21 17:26:57 2008 rpc - I created a test entry point, that loads the
	options in the IntraDayOptionsTest db, and is meant to run tests on that,
	this way, there is a seperate entry method for running backtests, or running trading
	platform, right now the interface is a bit unorganized, need to straighten it up before it
	gets out of hand!, 

* Thu Sep 18 11:57:07 2008 rpc - Once again, Amibrker was misunderstood by me,
	the "Round Lot Size" is what needs to be set to insure no fractional parts of shares, the
	"Min Shares" sets just that, the minimum number of shares, also, seeing wonderful results
	in uv101Rewrite1.afl, so implementing it in C++, 

* Sat Sep 13 11:45:01 2008 rpc - Email from Tomasz, turns out that
	I had been fooling around with a constant and a array, sellprice, in such a way that the
	logic was all screwed up, have new code in
	c:\data\AmiBroker\Formulas\Systems\UpVolatile\uv101Rewrite.afl that should work better, 

* Fri Sep 12 13:03:53 2008 rpc - It seems that Amibroker makes unjustifiable
	assumptions choosing an exit and entry price, and I can figure out how to get around it,

	UpVolatile102.cpp and .h are in the works, looking for the highest value in arbitrary (15)
	periods, thats hix, the lowest value before hix (***NOTE: the code doesn't take care of this!!!***,)
in that period is lix, then looking for a dip from
	that high, but not all the way to lix, thats lox, then a rise off lox, thats the buy, so,
	lixhixloxbuy, 

* Thu Sep 11 06:34:26 2008 rpc - Realistic backtesting seems to be a problem,
	the setting of the sellprice is critical, how do we mimic realtime?, Then there is the
	buyprice, same difference, UpVolatile101 created a starting point, but is it improvable to
	a useful place?, the purpose of life is the realization of Truth, all else is vain, 

* Wed Sep 10 06:30:19 2008 rpc - I'm looking at the buyprice, buy, sellprice, sell
	arrays generated both from Ami and IBCLR, for Appll-150, and they are not synched up,

	Have the arrays synched up again, something deleted accidently?, Now trying to get a
	sensible way to do the backtest/scan, there seem to be some unreasonable assumptions in
	AMI, the close always seems to be the high, rather than the close, and the entry price
	doesn't make a lot of sense either, trying to get a historical data request for 1M, 30
	mins filled, and it seems to have got lost!, so for the entry exit idea, using
	UpVolatile101 still, for
	`1 - Entry - use the previous period buyprice, see notes and changes in
	UpVolatile101::setupBuySell (UpVolatile101.cpp)
	

* Mon Sep 08 10:30:54 2008 rpc - Rough morning!,
	JoEllen's laptop is crashed from malware, the current went down during a reinsrtall of OS
	on her laptop,

	Created a new list of active options, so moved the IntraDayOptions to IntraDayOptionsTest,
	i.e., made IntraDayOptions empty, and then created a new list of relevant options using
	the monsterously named
	InsertIntoCurrentlyActiveOptionsLargeVolumeLatelyTopTenOptionsDistinctName.sql, now, will
	use that to create a brand new set of OptionsPages in IBCLR, how much hourly data can I
	download at one time from IB?  

	Because of the new functionality to insert a whole new list of options that are
	CurrentlyActive, that don't have any data yet in the DB, a new control path is followed:
	1 - click "Populate Options Pages From NewCurrent List" button
	2 - IBConnect button
	3 - "Option Pages Historical Data  Update " button

	For updating options that already have quote data in the DB:
	1 - CheckInLatestIntradayOptions button
	2 - Load Historic Data From DB button
	3 - IBConnect button
	4 - Option Pages Historical Data  Update  button

	The order above is only critical before the last step, after that to Run an Trade
	selector:
	1 - LoadOptionsPagesQuotesData button
	2 - RunATradeObject

	If there is data in the DB, IB doesn't have to be connected, you can do the PossibleTrades
	without the "Option Pages Historical Data  Update ",

* Sat Sep 06 14:11:43 2008 rpc - I have buy and sell
	as well as buyprice and sellprice perfectly coordinated with UpVolatile101.afl, see
	C:\data\TestOutput\uvDis1a.xlsx,

	On to defining actual trading opportunities!, Being advised to look at the IB trading
	interface being evolved for AmiBroker,

	For math, there is the Blitz library, at
	http://www.oonumerics.org/blitz/docs/blitz.html#SEC_Top,



* Fri Sep 05 05:26:57 2008 rpc - Valarray
	is a type in the Standard Library that is small, tight, and meant for mathematical
	operations, so this is what I'm doing, using valarray to hold the various arrays needed to
	compute a Tradable,

	A problem iterating over the collection of OptionsPages in OptionsPages::optionsPagesVec,
	I had left off the "&", and so a copy was being made, and operations were happening on the
	copy, watch out for that!, now, what about this thread safe singleton idea?, actually, the
	tread safetey is needed for certain parts, not the whole class, if at all.,

	I want to write all the arrays out to a file, that can be read in Excel, so, need a
	dumpFile routine, put it in c:\data\cpp-projects\IB-CLR\UpVolatile101.cpp

	Up to doing the sel and buy sellprice buyprice, then we are getting close to finished,

* Thu Sep 04 09:01:28 2008 rpc - For UpVolatile101 TradeObject,
	these are the elements that need to be defined/created,

	9 & 10 really only need 1 array, i.e., 10, 9 is only used to compute 10,
	11 is just 10 * constant multi, so 9, 10, 11 are only 1 vector

	14 & 15 are only used to compute 16, and 18 is just 16 renamed,

	17 had llvBars and hhvBars, so relies on 2 vectors not enumerated here,

	19-22 are the complex ones, they each represent a vector, but rely on many other vectors
	defined previously,

	Not quite sure why, but to use a float constant to multiply a valarray, had to use a local
	var, then set it to the class member, trying to use the class member, even though it was
	the right type, resulted in an error, see "nv.va *= 100;" in c:\data\cpp-projects\IB-CLR\UpVolatile101.cpp

	19 - Buy = 0; 
	20 - Sell = 0; 
	21 - sellPrice = 0;
	22 - buyPrice = llv1 + (retraceSetup * dif1);


* Tue Sep 02 09:24:31 2008 rpc - The Boost and Quantlib libraries
	are needed for development, the Boost boost_1_35_0_setup.exe in zips is the installer
	program, I'm starting out installing just Debug DLL and DLL versions, for others, run the
	installer again, the installer was downloaded from http://www.boostpro.com/products/free, 
	destination path is C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_35_0, Can't seem to find anything
	useful right now,  should download Quantlib in the future sometime, 

* Mon Sep 01 10:17:52 2008 rpc - Set up the "semaphore"
	but because it is only being read by one thread and written by one thread, not worrying
	about thread safety right now, downloaded the whole enchilada, have teh hourlies for the
	top tenners in the Options2 SqlServer DB, 

* Sat Aug 30 13:27:53 2008 rpc - The HistoricData call worked well with only
	one ticker, but using the whole list, something didn't work right, for tomorrow - Use
	Globals.h to establish a thread safe semaphore that can be used between
	c:\data\cpp-projects\IB-CLR\HistoricalDataInsertThread.cpp and
	OptionsPages::requestCurrentHistoricalData, might want to invoke function
	HistoricalDataInsertThread::ThreadProc without spinning a thread, set the semaphore in
	HistoricalDataInsertThread::ThreadProc when done processing, and wait in
	OptionsPages::requestCurrentHistoricalData til that happens, thus only having one request
	active at a time, until it is finished,

	On to the actual selecting of a buy list, then the sell parameters, I can look in
	AmiBroker at the Code for UpVolatile101.afl, and build code in C++ that reflects that, I
	can use Excel, or OpenOffice, to figure out the necessary steps,
	

* Fri Aug 29 07:34:14 2008 rpc - The application is nearing completion,
	The ErrorWindow requires cross-thread Form communication, which means that a Delegate has
	to be Invoked, one is now defined in ErrorWindow.h, see code for writeToTextBox(String^
	strIn) there, 

	DateTime problem, IB returns this kind of string "20080731  07:00:00" and thats not easily
	translated by CLR, problem solved using DateTime::ParseExact in
	c:\data\cpp-projects\IB-CLR\HistoricalDataInsertThread.cpp 

* Wed Aug 27 09:54:00 2008 rpc - I have setup the OptionsPages in IB-CLR
	they will be a central component, respnsible for caching all relevant Options Contracts,
	DB names, everything but the prices, which will be in the DB,

* Mon Aug 25 05:04:52 2008 rpc - Checking out C language API for TWS workstation clients
	This is on Sourceforge at http://sf.net/projects/tws-c-api All stuff is in c:\tws-c-api,
	* Sat Aug 30 13:41:18 2008 rpc - This is the backbone of IB-CLR, the best interface found,
	

	Compiled easily, runs, now see if I can integrate it into IB-CLR, * Wed Aug 27 09:55:50
	2008 rpc - It is fully integrated,

	Reloading IB-CLR on laptop, just changed 2 occurences of RICK-DESKTOP to RICKSLAPTOP, and
	everything is OK!,

	


* Thu Aug 21 13:17:53 2008 rpc - For Selecting only a symbols quotes
	use the BindingSource..::.Filter Property ,
ms-help://MS.VSCC.v90/MS.MSDNQTR.v90.en/fxref_system.windows.forms/html/528f1197-7a87-a7ea-e3fc-6fb15c41f74a.htm#exampleToggle


* Wed Aug 20 14:11:56 2008 rpc - FINALLY HAVE IT GOING ON THE DESKTOP
	WHAT NEEDED DOING,
	On transferring it over, went into Sql Server 2005 and created a new alias under Native
	Configuration, this is in the Configuration Manager, not sure this was necessary, but it
	was part of what I did, the main thing that seemed to clinch it was editing the
	OptionsDBDataSet.xsd file in the code editor, it's some sort of xml file, and I searched
	for RICKSLAPTOP, the data source on my laptop, and replaced the one occurence with
	RICK-DESKTOP, where my sql server is here, this is only part of what I did, but the rest
	is sort of obvious, like deleting all the files in debug dir, and release dir, going into
	the data adapters and making sure they could see their connection ok, but the change in
	the xsd file really seems to be the bisquit, of course, I had attached the Options2 DB to
	the local server, etc.,

* Wed Aug 20 07:03:16 2008 rpc - After transfering to the Desktop
	None of the TableAdapters work!, LatestIntraDayOptions, LatestIntraDayOptionsTableAdapter, 

* Tue Aug 19 21:56:35 2008 rpc - Went down, now on desktop,	

* Tue Aug 19 17:54:52 2008 rpc - Have created a more thorough backup.bat in \data,
	hd acted like it was going down, ok right now, have a new one coming, 

* Tue Aug 19 07:17:12 2008 rpc - I get a
	Pacing error from the historical data service, that is error code 162, I believe the limit
	is 60 symbols within a 10? min period, if that's the case, setting the pause to 10secs
	would do,

* Mon Aug 18 21:21:32 2008 rpc - Creating a
	notes-samplecode.cpp for good code samples found,

* Sun Aug 17 05:26:54 2008 rpc - The code for client2,
	The TestSockets prgram from IB, is now wrapped in a Mfc dll, this makes it reachable from
	a forms based application, which is what I have in IB-CLR, the project right now is in
	TestForm, but will move that, to move the socket code to a dll required building a naked
	mfc dll project, and then loading the resource.rc, resource.h, and .h, .cpp files from
	client2 into the project, now I'm going to see if I can make it /clr, so I can pass it
	references to SQL DataTables, or other Sql Server artifacts,

* Fri Aug 15 15:33:45 2008 rpc - Now they are working,
	Needed to load it in the Solution that had IBtoAmi because of a reference to IBtoAmi in
	IB-CLR,


* Fri Aug 15 13:46:39 2008 rpc - No luck so far,
	MFC and CLR don't work that well together, and my Forms keep breaking, the designer keeps
	giving error msgs, For Reasons completely unfathomable to me, all the forms and DataSet in
	IB-CLR won't load in their designers, which makes them pretty useless,


* Fri Aug 15 12:01:50 2008 rpc - Yet another tack,
	It looks like using the client2 code, the MFC socket client, will complile with CLR, so
	I'm trying to get it to work with all the great .NET stuff for SqlServer,

	

* Thu Aug 14 10:53:46 2008 rpc - Very excited about this CLR Database
	model, the DataSet can hold multiple tables, views, etc, that are easily renamed and bound
	to DataGridViews, Tools/Choose Toolbox Items had to be selected to get the SQL Server
	tools into the toolbox, The DataGridView SelectionMode Property needs to be set to
	FullRowSelect to allow deletes, assuming you want edit capabilities, the process is,

	Set up a Db connection, set up a DataAdapter, set up a DataSet, Set up a BindingSource,
	then you can setup the DataGridView, this is nice, really really nice,
	After this for 1 DataAdapter, I went into the DataSet Designer and actually created
	TableAdapter from there, See the code in the OptionsDB.h file for details,

	On to the TWS control,
	OH SHIT! The CLR stuff is great, but the TWS control relies upon MFC classes that
	implement the IContract, and other interfaces, which makes it pretty useless for my
	purposes, so, back to the TWSApi, I can use the stuff I've already done in IBtoAmi,
	just define necessary entry points, I Think...,

* Wed Aug 13 18:30:08 2008 rpc - It's been a long hard day,
	but I've learned a lot, have the IB-CLR data connection test working by code, and
	discovered the SqlCommand, SqlDataAdapter, etc., weren't in the Toolbox for form design
	because they hadn't been selected, so, in Tools/Choose Toolbox Items, I found them and
	checked them off, and there they are!,

* Wed Aug 13 11:23:49 2008 rpc - Am using TWS control inside of a
	CLR Windows Form, and developing now in the CLR environment, see where this takes me, 

* Tue Aug 12 10:54:16 2008 rpc - I'm afraid there are too many
	gotchas in Amibroker, so, looks like writing code to do entry-exit systems is going to
	fall, 

	

* Mon Aug 11 06:00:03 2008 rpc - Today I begin working on the autotrade,
	First I'm looking at the processing of the c:\data\AmiBroker\Formulas\Systems\Backtest
	file SignalProc2.afl, to get a feeling for how I might send the trade off, and remove a
	trade if I either exit early, don't get in, or get in for a different price than the
	buyprice, or out for a different price than the sellprice, 

* Sun Aug 10 15:04:01 2008 rpc - For DB connectivity,
	ODBC - gives me Excel too, Control Panel/Administrative Tools to set up connections,
	Started an notes-odbc file, SEE c:\data\cpp-projects\TWS-SocketClient\OUTPUT for a dump of
	hour quotes for 1 month,

	For a first cut, I'm going to pump historical data into one big file, then upload that
	file into SqlServer,

	The data for a given option comes in all at once, sequentially, so I want to collect all
	of it before issuing another call, will have to use a signal flag, collect the array in
	historicalData(), and send it on after I have it all, call reqhistoricaldata() again after
	I'm done processing, so the whole thing is happening in a loop, 
	In TwsToAmi.cpp
	void TwsWrapper::historicalData( TickerId reqId, const CString& date, double open, double high, double low, double close, int volume,
                             int barCount, double WAP, int hasGaps )
   {
  	OptionsPages::Instance()->updateHistoricalData(reqId, date, open, high, low, close, volume, barCount, WAP, hasGaps);


* Sat Aug 09 14:16:56 2008 rpc - Well, after thrashing around for hours,
	I realize that Microsoft hasn't done much for C++ in the Interop world, it's
	best to use the naked COM stuff,

* Thu Aug 07 17:41:03 2008 rpc - I'm having to change the symbol of the options,
	yet again, because IB is using spaces ocassionally in the option local-symbol, so, looking
	at putting all the necessary to parse out in the name again, 
	
* Wed Aug 06 18:33:12 2008 rpc - Hit a wall with Amibroker,
	the symbol length is limited to 25 chars, and current naming scheme doesn't work, so
	changing the symbol to the OPRA symbol + strike, which is what IB needs, and the full name
	to the old naming convention, 

* Wed Aug 06 13:39:39 2008 rpc - I'm thinking about how to create the autotrade
	capability,



* Tue Aug 05 13:50:28 2008 rpc - I have the GetQuotes working
	to a great degree, seems great right now, So, the next thing is the "automated trading"
	part, this is what I'm looking at comexcel for, motivation is to use Excel for future
	reference as well, 

* Sun Aug 03 16:29:03 2008 rpc - The #import statement is used in
	cpp-projects\comexcel, these lines
	#import _MSDLL_PATH rename("RGB", "MSRGB")
	#import "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\VBA\VBA6\VBE6EXT.OLB"
	#import "progid:Excel.Sheet" auto_search auto_rename rename_search_namespace("Office12") 
	#import _MSEXCEL_PATH auto_search auto_rename dual_interfaces
	where _MSEXCEL_PATH = "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\excel.exe"

	obviously, the #import plays a crucial part in using COM without resorting to MFC or ATL,

	To run midl, I am starting the VC Cmd prompt, here is the actual command that it executes:
	%comspec% /k ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"" x86, to run
	in Xemacs, "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86 works.

* Sat Aug 02 13:12:02 2008 rpc - After a few hours of thrashing around COM,
	to try and link to AmiBroker, I found out that it is absolutely essential to call
	CoInitialize(), if you don't do this, nothing works, thanks to
	http://netez.com/2xExplorer/shellFAQ/bg_com.html

	The beta Typelib for AmiBroker seems to work better than the regular, 


* Fri Aug 01 10:11:37 2008 rpc - Regarding GetQuotes,
	There are some issues about when Ami calls it, run the UnsetUseLocalDatabase.afl in
	c:\data\AmiBroker\Formulas\Utils, this makes the Backtester call the GetQuotes func when
	the item is hit in the backtest, See the project AmiIB, which has all the projects I'm
	working on in it, most relevant right now is IBtoAmi which is the dll for the data
	transfer, this weekend I plan on working on the COM interface, to launch the backtester in
	a timer, and load the results into C++ code, to do auto trading eventually, 

* Wed Jul 30 14:50:08 2008 rpc - The file
	c:\data\cpp-projects\IBtoAmi\TWSApi.cpp has the code that was working testing the IBtoAmi
	dll, I have broken it out into a class file, TwsWrapper, and a file for the functions
	called int the TwsApi, the TwsApi class files, 

* Mon Jul 28 09:28:22 2008 rpc - Up to getting the data from TWS into Ami
	- Set up the calls to TWS with the record numbers the same as the index used in the
	RecentInfo structure of AmiADK, I'm not going to use GetQuotes, just GetRecentInfo, the
	RecentInfo struct is keyed by the long ticker field used in Ami, from which I can extract
	the stuff, fields, needed by TWS, there can be a "holder class", that holds the Contract
	needed by TWS and the RecentInfo needed by Ami, Only access to the RecentInfo class needs
	to be locked, 

* Sat Jul 26 13:12:39 2008 rpc - Saved the Options for latest
	in SQL-QUERIES, load into Ami, then into RealTimeWindow, etc.

* Fri Jul 25 20:19:39 2008 rpc - Coming along with the data feed,
	Looking at Equity in Ami,

* Thu Jul 24 18:36:59 2008 rpc - Have to use DebugView to look at
	what's going on inside of AmiBroker, as the Debugging info in the DLL seems to get lost
	when it's attached, so using OutputDebugString(), here are teh first calls when Ami starts
	up:
	[1344] GetPluginInfo called
	[1344] Init called
	[1344] Notify called
	[1344] GetQuotes called, 
	[1344] GetQuotes called, 


* Mon Jul 21 10:36:59 2008 rpc - Getting setup after laptop disk gone,
	Good because Ican gt it down to really only what I need,
	Sql Server, IE, IB, AmiBroker, DivX, Xemacs, Visual Studio,

* Mon Jul 07 15:23:39 2008 rpc - Adding the metric to
	only choose 1 position from each underlying, see
	c:\data\AmiBroker\Formulas\Systems\Backtest\SignalProc2.afl 

* Sat Jul 05 08:21:46 2008 rpc - I have realized that simple strategies are best,
	Creating UpVolatile1.1.afl correcting errors in 1.0,

	UpVolatile1.0.afl -
		- 	The cond1 is showing a countertrend drop, but a primary trend has never been
			established to show it is a "countertrend", So, there needs to be a primary trend
			established first!,
	

* Fri Jul 04 17:41:57 2008 rpc - I need to pay more attention to detail,
	I tend to miss a lot of logic errors, not present enough,

* Fri Jul 04 12:30:31 2008 rpc - Moving along,
	Looking at the Backtester in AmiBroker, offers a level of sophistication that could be
	useful, 

* Thu Jul 03 12:32:18 2008 rpc - It seems that there is no help available from IB
	for the API, but there is the message board at Yahoo!, On to defining my own classes,
	built on top of the Socket interface provided, 

* Wed Jul 02 16:02:15 2008 rpc - IB has done a pretty shabby job with the C++ Socket code, but have
	managed to get the TestSocketClient code working by making changes I caught myself, and
	one that I found in the TWS-API Yahoo group, that had to do with a bad implementation of
	CWinThread in c:\Jts\SocketClient\src\EClientSocket.cpp, see * Wed Jul 02 16:05:30 2008
	rpc - in that file.

	THE WAY THE THING WORKS:
	Class EClientSocket is responsible for making calls into IB, see it's methods in
	zips\IB\APIPrintable.pdf, the SocketClient Properties listed below that are the structures
	used throughout, such as Contract, OrderSTate, the class EWrapper holds the functions tat
	are called by IB to deliver the asked for information,



* Tue Jul 01 11:58:15 2008 rpc - I haven't been able to get any IB C++ code working,
	I'm going to delete and reload all the stuff from IB, maybe I have some stuff leftover or
	something,


* Mon Jun 30 09:37:55 2008 rpc - Have amazing results in UpVolatile1Options.afl
	and am tuning it, need to get at strikePercentOfULprice using a datenum to get at the
	foreign array somehow...
	Now I'm going to work on getting quotes from IB into AMI,

* Wed Jun 25 11:24:15 2008 rpc - It seemed sensible,
	to switch back to IB for buying options, and the possibility of automating the trades,
	but the data may still be a problem, as IB is a bit stingy in that dept.,

* Mon Jun 23 09:23:24 2008 rpc - Running the UpVolatile on the options,
	there were incredible results, showing 6000%+ annualized returns, actually 180053.89 %,
	but this was trading all options on QQQQ, going to limit the entry price, etc.,

* Sat Jun 21 11:29:54 2008 rpc - 	

* Fri Jun 20 12:58:37 2008 rpc - Working on the Linear Regression Line Slope combined with Candles
	idea, 

* Tue Jun 17 16:18:15 2008 rpc - Since Options are what I'm going to trade,
	I'm making a table of QQQQ options only, and restrincting them to options that traded for
	a dollar at least once, then I'm using the method of finding options that traded for a 50%
	or greater propfit within some 20 day period, this is arbitrary but a place to start, 

* Mon Jun 16 13:13:41 2008 rpc - On to the next step,
	Defining a protocol for entering a trade, looking at options on QQQQ that return more than
	50% over any time period, and then look back at the charts to see if a recognizable
	pattern is in the price charts, am also looking at Neural Nets, but not sure I want to
	follow that road, maybe, 

* Fri Jun 13 11:04:18 2008 rpc - I have been working in
	data\cpp-projects\Candle for the last few days, remembering C++ and how to do it, Now I
	have the candle code a bit more lovable, but there is a lot of work to be done, how
	exactly should I define the attributes of each Candle?, there is its relation with the
	candle preceeding it, and there are it's own characteristics, that suggests 2 numeric
	arrays, one that encapsulates the relationship, and one that encapsulates characteristics
	of itself, I'm building  bodySize and fullSize fuctions, along with wick functions, these
	4 elements make up the Candle, along with the black/white/doji characteristics, then we
	need to move on to the R^2 and LineRegSlope ideas, 

* Mon Jun 09 13:03:33 2008 rpc - A 5-20Browser.afl in indicators-ricks
	is for looking for 5 day patterns, and then seeing what happens in the next 20 days, the
	idea being that we only need a hint that price is likely to rise/fall by significant
	amount during the next 20 days after the pattern appears,

* Sat Jun 07 16:14:34 2008 rpc - After succesfully building
	static MT Quantlib libraries, I built the example for equity options, see
	c:\QuantLib-0.9.0\Examples\EquityOption, I move Quantlib and Boost libs to the root, ie,
	c:\boost_1_35_0\ and c:\QuantLib-0.9.0. 

* Fri Jun 06 10:24:51 2008 rpc - Looking at the mathematics of Option PRicing,
	A good site is http://www.espenhaug.com, fellow has loads of info there.

	I have installed the Boost c++ dlls, in \Program Files\boost. Docs are there as
	well. http://www.boost.org/ is parent site, Had to compile everything static to get the
	debug libs to work because of linking problems.
	These were necessary for the Quantlib libraries, which I'm installing, these have
	all sorts of Financial, Options, stuff.

* Thu Jun 05 10:15:39 2008 rpc -
	AMGN came to me in meditation, after a thought about the politicians being able to buy
	stocks and make laws, so, what is the play here? 

* Thu May 29 19:54:20 2008 rpc - Seems that everyday
	has it's own tasks...

* Wed May 28 16:21:31 2008 rpc - Am using C++ for the first time
	in a long time,

* Sun May 25 18:43:45 2008 rpc - Am going to define
	functions to give definition to the idea of the 6 different trend categories,
	up-volatile, up-smooth, down-volatile, down smooth, and sideways-volatile,
	sideways-smooth, first there is the slope of a line over some periods, 

* Mon May 19 06:56:04 2008 rpc - Naming Conventions,
	should give more information, call the dropAmt in UpVolatile1.afl the counterTrendDropSetup,
	and rise1 the retraceSetup, and rise2 the retraceBuy, 

* Sun May 18 11:52:05 2008 rpc - Am looking at UpVolatile.afl,
	Want to find a way to take into account continuation patterns,

* Sat May 17 15:42:49 2008 rpc - Have defined UpDownPeriods.afl,
	which gives the frequency in % of up and down periods over some range of periods,
	How important is it to be "mechanical"?, i.e., does it make sense to use my discretion on
	the mechanical trading system?, Or is this not following the rules?, the goal is to have a
	set of rules that can be followed carefully, without resorting to discretion,

* Thu May 15 13:29:10 2008 rpc - Have combined the Up and Down
	Into BothAnd0.afl (data\AmiBroker\Formulas\Systems), and it gives pretty results,
	The hot-shots are when both buy-and-cover, or short-and-sell, are 1,

* Mon May 12 10:43:02 2008 rpc - Am going to use DownVolatile
	to develop an UpVolatile.afl, then design a trend finder, using the EMA of HHV vs LLV over
	last 28 days, when it's rising, up trend, etc., needs work, 

* Sun May 11 13:04:06 2008 rpc - DownVolatile,
	1 and 2, are both pretty robust, and even show small profits against rising stocks,

* Sat May 10 09:20:00 2008 rpc - I ran a query on the TAW data
	to find the options with the biggest volume lately, and have updated the master list with
	some new entries, 
	LEFT OFF doing a step thru on the DownVolatile list on BAC, looks like the short-cover is
	getting scrambled there,maybe need a "range bound" system, 

* Thu May 08 11:25:43 2008 rpc - Regarding the 3 strategies,
	I'm creating folders under AmiBroker\Formulas\Systems that define general trends:
	1 - DownVolatile - This is where the mkts have been lately, though it looks like a change
	may be here, (NOTE* Fib0.1.afl bcomes DownVolatile0.afl,
	2 - DownTrend - Going down, but not with a lot of big bumps,
	3 - SidewaysVolatile - Sideways in a broad range,
	4 - SidewaysSmooth - not much range,
	5 - UpTrend - Up, but not a major amount of volatility,
	6 - UpVolatile - Going up, but lots of bouncing,

* Mon May 05 11:39:15 2008 rpc - Working on the Setup
	1 - 3 strategies, up, down, and sideways, 'working on down right now
	2 - For the down, using the concepts from the Fibonacci retracements, I believe the low
	should preceed the high, and the difference between them should be some % of the current
	price, so that a 23.8% drop has some significance, This might be influenced heavily by the
	price of the underlying, like the idxs, that don't change by such large %s as the stocks,
	so it might behoove me to create a procedure for each entity in the master list, I'm going
	to start with MER, totally arbitrary, 

* Fri May 02 16:50:49 2008 rpc - So, What does a Setup Look like?,
	The Fib0 retracement indicator gave off some good vibes, Let's look at that further, the
	general idea I'm following now is that if it rises (fall) x, then it will go on to rise
	(fall) y, then I will buy calls (puts) at 2% of risk tolerance, AB has a new Backtester
	AFL interface, so I can test stuff much closer to what I would trade, 

* Thu May 01 15:06:37 2008 rpc - I'm starting to work on a Channel
	drawing indicator, to combine with the Fib retracements, 

* Sun Apr 27 11:56:39 2008 rpc - My Tasks
	is to develop a mechanical trading system, I have some code in
	~\Amibroker\formulas\Systems, I will start from there,

* Thu Apr 24 13:11:13 2008 rpc - SPDailyChangeTable1.sql is the code
	for calculating the daily change in the options close, also, have updated the whole
	MasterInPlayList0308Options table with the close from the MasterInPlayList0308DailyQuotes
	table which has the underlying quotes from Yahoo, now the daily change in those needs to
	be calculated, and then that daily change compared with the daily change in the options
	daily close, if the options change is greater than the ul change, there is bad data, two
	columns have been added to the MasterInPlayList0308Options table, DayChange and
	ULDayChange to tale these values,

	It is possible for an option to rise by a bigger value than the rise of the underlying
	Have created PlotUnderlying.afl in Amibroker explorations, that plots the underlying for
	any options inserted via SQL Server, because of the number of days between option trades, 

 	A problem with trying to find the changes is that the options don't trade every day, so
	can change by more than 1 delta, 

* Tue Apr 22 09:26:53 2008 rpc - I am working on getting the data cleaned up,
	First, I will put the quotation data for the MasterList stocks and idxs into the DB, then
	I will perform the sanity check on the option price changes mentioned below, there is no
	difference between this dust and any other, it is all God, Let the consciousness of God

	it only takes a few right choices to become a great winner at the stock/option trading game, 

* Mon Apr 21 09:18:06 2008 rpc - Since there is so much dirty data in TBSP data,
	I'm going to spend some effort to clean it up, first, any option cannot change by more $
	amt than the underlying, so, the underlying difference in close between any 2 days must be
	more than the option close between those same days,

* Sun Apr 20 19:53:28 2008 rpc - To get the TBSP data
	into SQL Server,
	1 - FTP to ftp://tbsp.com/Quotes_Daily/daily_options_BA/ this is the data files that has

	2 - Download the relevant files to c:\zips\TBSP-Data

* Tue Apr 15 15:31:42 2008 rpc - Have created a MasterInPlayList0308Options table in the O database,

* Sat Apr 12 09:46:37 2008 rpc - When a channel becomes too long,
	it is possibly played out, and the same for retracements, there is a time element that
	must be identified, check out the Fibonacci time zones, (time elements), and see if there
	is something helpful there, the thing about Fibonacci is the love of the nature, finding
	patterns that occur in nature, and that is why they work, working on the SQL stuff, want
	to get an easy way to insert all the data for the options into the O database, see

	I'm signed up for unlimited Internet Access by the month, Have the ASCII downloader,
	but might be best to just ftp, and put the stuff in the SQL Server DB, will have to
	relearn how to use it!,

* Thu Apr 10 10:25:15 2008 rpc - A database of trading setups -
	Definable Setup (DS) 1 - Increasing volatility leads to increased option premiums. Buy, (straddle near the
	money is purist, directional is mixed, depends on making a directional call)
	DS 2 - Because of volatility skew, buying far out strangle, and selling close in strangle at
	same strikes could be a verile trade, or straddle? 1 and 2 are volatility plays.

	Stay in touch with the mkts,
	Use cheap options,
	A vast interplay of Energy Fields, all interrelated, all knowable,
	reinging more data to your trading environment gives you more survivability in the mkts,
	Build a database of definable setups,


* Tue Apr 08 11:19:30 2008 rpc -
	I like the idea of playing the, "BEAR", 1 - the downside happens faster, quicker falls in
	less time, 2 - puts are cheaper than calls generally, 3 - it fits in better with my glee
	at any collapse of big business, 4 - the only really winning portfolio that fits my kind
	of trading I've seen to date is Tim Knight's, and this is his way of trading,

* Mon Apr 07 13:45:27 2008 rpc -
	The Jul25P on YHOO is up to 1.59.
	
* Sun Apr 06 17:48:53 2008 rpc - I need to define setups, or a setup,
	The selection of stocks to run the setup on, then the setup itself,
	I could use visual setups, and just filter lists for activity in options,
	AMGN looks to me like it could hit 31 based on a cycle fit, see Cyc in Amibroker, that
	would return 384 for a 38 bet,
	AET - little nervous about the looks of the cycle peaks, and support, but they could bip
	down on earnings on the 23rd, but it fell heavy on the last "up" cycle,

* Sat Apr 05 10:28:48 2008 rpc - The Tuning Fork, may it resonate here,
	Looking at options and their movements over time can give you an idea of where the stock
	is going. You may want to download data again from TBSP, making a list of all the
	healthcare losers in the SPQQQ combo group, and look for neg delta spreads, note that the
	def of health care in Amibroker is way broader than TOS, which really divides things out
	in a different way, fellow Tim Knight who started Prophet has nice blog at "The Slope of
	Hope", on 3/26, I tuited that 8 to 17 weeks out to buy, 17 weeks is 119 days, 8 is 56
	days, and hold?, 0 to whatever makes sense, probably less than a week for some, more than
	a week for others, creating a put list on Prophet, AMGN is first entry,
	AMGN earnings on 4/24, channel is 47.5-29.66 current is 41.62, I think it will drop,
	before or soon after 24th, The breakeven is around 38.76 on 4/24, and it it hit 29.66 on
	that date, it would make $525 for a 36 purchase, so more than 10x, Very similar situation
	with AET, 

* Fri Apr 04 10:23:53 2008 rpc - Watching the MOS trade that insanemoney has on,
	Also, going back to my list of 100 big vol, to get more play, what I noticed from this MOS
	trade is it has big vol, but is low on the 0308 list, at 123, so, might want to use daily
	option volume data, Used and intersection via scan to cross large sizzlers, 200 of them,
	with big optvol0108, CVX was only one, lots of put activity around 85, stock at 88, no
	doubt these guys are greedy pigs, 16B fine pending in Ecuador for dumping, pigs, pigs,
	pigs., Earnings call is 5/2.

* Thu Apr 03 15:39:42 2008 rpc - Spent some time looking at various trading groups and blogs,
	particularly liked insanemoney.com, fellow trades like I do, TOS and spreads, but probably
	not the tuning fork or intuition, or (maybe) the smells of greed and fear, lots of traders
	out there like me, should I be more of a communicator?, Yes, it's not a bad thing, it will
	help you maintain a good attitude, from what I'm seeing, I think I will search for
	opportunities across a wider audience, like the QQQQ and SP500 combined, 

* Tue Apr 01 09:20:16 2008 rpc - Looking at the B/A spreads, QQQQ has it all over the rest,
	It's spreads are a couple of cents, whereas the SPX is a couple of dollars! These spreads
	can kill you, and even more so if you are legging, So, let's find the big one's with small
	B/A spreads, they are, QQQQ, I have a small list that is these low B/A spread options,
	DIA, SPY, IWM, QQQQ, and XLF, I am going to focus on these 5 for now.

* Mon Mar 31 10:48:29 2008 rpc - The following plays occured to me this morning,
	If CCU has settled into a consolidation or is poking up, sell a near term, near money
	put. based on the theory that it will go down more, Whole Foods should develop an up
	trend if it is done getting clobbered, a longer term purchase, or call, or sell puts?,
	maybe not this last. I want CCU to bip up more first. WFMI is still in a down trend.
	Spreads create a sense of excitement in me. Am I being foolish, or is this a good way to
	trade?, It can be lucrative, but also dangerous, all trading is dangerous,

* Sat Mar 29 07:16:48 2008 rpc - I'm trying to make this trading a first class citizen, 
	like meditation, so that my highest intentions for it are realized, to form a basis for a
	deep knowledge of the world process, and a methodology to alleviate suffering. The
	interplay of darkness and light is so massive in the mkts, so much darkness, so little
	light! So, the first thing is to bring more light to the mkts, my prayer is to bring more
	light to the mkts, your body is your trading machine, it's intuitions are predominant in
	an effective methodology, your hatha yoga can help, as can your pranayama, notice how you
	cough when you do pranayama at trading, because the air of the trading environment is less
	cleansed than the air of the meditation couch, notice how the appetites are more intense,
	notice how the heart aches, it is a harsh cold environment, and you are well suited to
	master it, so, let's go look at the mkts, looked at TTWO, a computer game maker, which
	jumped really high on 2/25 on a takeover bid from another, actually, TOS news had the best
	reporting on it, of the ones checked, also, could have made 10x money on an April call if
	bought on 2/21, but how would you ever know that?, 

* Fri Mar 28 08:39:41 2008 rpc - .YHQSE is @ 1.34, even though YHOO is up .16
	Also, the charts now say it closed at 1.31 yesterday, which is not what I saw.
	I need to develop a more disciplined trading mentality. Focus, not doing it while I'm
	doing everything else.

* Thu Mar 27 16:03:04 2008 rpc - .YHQSE is still at 1.27
	YHOO is down 1.4%, Actually, YHQSE mark is 1.28, so it is up a penny. The Theta about took
	care of the slight drop in YHOO. So, Single options, simple directional plays, or, selling
	puts, could be flat plays.

* Wed Mar 26 16:34:37 2008 rpc - Looked at the Double-Double at RedOption and it's a wash
	A little bit more or less than paying for your trades. The message I get is to do single
	options. Not spreads, but directional single buys. What time frame, how long should I
	hold? One to Five Weeks. How far out should I buy them? Eight to Seventeen weeks.
	I'm looking at a single option, an Jul25Put on YHOO. Right now it's at 1.27, I'll watch
	how tomorrow goes, and journal my experience. This is the way to trade, consciously, aware
	of every minute feeling that might effect the position. My body is my trading machine.

* Thu Mar 20 16:54:06 2008 rpc - Well, I lost 1600 CORRECTION for some reason, it didn't come out that way, but a 900 profit.
	Think they must have closed it out early in the day.
	on the SPX vertical. Every trade found by the spread hacker to have a good positive return
	lost money. So, I don't think I've found a valid method here. Just too rediculous, loss
	money all the time. Guess it's time to move on from this trading stuff. If it was only
	this one loss, but every trade with a positive return that I got from the spread hacker
	was a losser.


* Wed Mar 19 14:17:40 2008 rpc - Yesterdays bounce was scary, thought I was had.
	But, today things look better. One more day to go.

* Tue Mar 11 10:37:21 2008 rpc - The bounce occured this morning, so setups might be here.
	Looking at the March verts to see if anything with negative delta looks good.
	Entered a 1325/30 SPX call bear for 1.80 limit. It's not going off, the temp rally seems
	to be over for now. My feeling is 85%, so ER is 32.8%. iT WENT OFF AT 1357EST. Bouncing
	around all over the place. Definitely a big bounce underway. Watch and learn! Only has 9
	days til expiration, and break even is 1326.83. On the SpreadHacker the %profit is a % of
	max loss. So max loss is always 100%.

* Mon Mar 10 10:36:11 2008 rpc - How do I know when to enter the mkt?
	Right now the entry would be negative delta, and I'm afraid of a bounce this next
	week. It's been headed down pretty precipitously for a time, and a bounce seems
	likely. When the bounce is well under way would be the time to jump in, so it looks like
	it might not be for March expiration, but April.

* Sat Mar 08 17:37:04 2008 rpc - So, it's changed to 10 biggest opt vol and idxs.
	I will look at the near term verts. The positions have to fit the mkt, which right now is
	decidedly bearish. So, bear calls. Look at 20 days or so. There are 14 Big vol Idxs, so
	the total list is 28.

* Fri Mar 07 11:12:27 2008 rpc - Am going to concentrate on the 20 largest option volume equities and idxs.
	And going to focus on near term credit verts. Have created numerous spreadsheets from
	SpreadHacker, expanding with an expected value column. Idea is to only trade when EV is
	consistently good over a few day period. for a given spread.

* Tue Feb 26 17:12:03 2008 rpc - Signed up for the Red Option Index Calendar Strategy.

	MFN - Monthly chart, looks like its headed for the stars.



* Mon Feb 13 13:04:40 2006 rpc - Feb so far has been gargantuan losses.
	Every position stopped out. Obviously in the wrong place at the wrong time.

* Tue Jan 31 11:57:44 2006 rpc - In the game not paper trading.
	In Play - ENG, PLLL, CFW
	ShortList - ATHR, PKD, PLLL, TMY, TRE, ENG, SIFY, WPCS, WTZ, CFW, ESLR, RWC


* Fri Jan 20 18:17:05 2006 rpc - Add ATHR to papertrading

* Thu Jan 19 20:34:16 2006 rpc - These are symbols to be considered for actual trades -
	ENER PLLL TMY ARNA ADEX AXCA TRE because they have all been in synch with me, so far.

* Wed Jan 18 18:11:40 2006 rpc - Couple of decent months, paper trading.
	Add ATHR, 

* Thu Dec 29 00:21:44 2005 rpc - One of the things I learned to day is
	To have respect for my past efforts. Most of them are formidable.

* Mon Nov 28 14:37:03 2005 rpc - My EDGE -
	- Willing to take time to understand difficult concepts.
	- Willing to accept risk of loss as part of the game. (Work on this!) IE - willing to
	sustain losses when the system loses.
	- Will follow a system if I have faith in it.
	- Will take the time to build an effective system.
	- Think outside the box.
	- Meditate regularly to keep mind clear, among the real reason of merging the individual
	with the Universal Mind.

* Sun Nov 27 13:15:58 2005 rpc - Buy Sell signals
	Sell after a reaction if there is no rally	

* Wed Nov 16 19:29:19 2005 rpc - Noting that a lot of up action seems to happen around stocks that have an up close on
	heavy volume. Going to screen for that using AmiBroker.

* Mon Jun 20 12:10:21 2005 rpc - Into the Euro again at 1.2182 again short
	this time with a .0100 trail. Lost ~650 on last one. Tricky the way they report it because
	they Mark to Market every day for futures. Have to look at each day since trade started
	and add things up to get the whole picture. Fucked again. Lost a few hundred. 

* Mon Jun 13 14:12:22 2005 rpc - Sold my first future. A mini-eur (e7 on globex)
	Sold it for 1.2151. Each $0.0001 is worth $6.25, so if it goes to 1.2050, I make $625.
	IF it goes to 1.2251, I lose $625. Put a 200 pip trail on it. Lost money on it.

* Sun Jun 05 15:11:26 2005 rpc - Actual trading is going to be isolated in C:\data\TradingEducation\PaperTrading.xls
	and here will be the "meta process". I'm looking at chart for INTC compared against
	QQQQ. It looks like INTC is a predictor of QQQQ. The way I see it, QQQ is going up over
	the next 2 months. I have a strong optimistic feeling for the SPX as well. This is from
	looking at the continuous SPX contracts ES1600 and the OI pattern in it. How do these
	predictions work out? What ae these "Strong Feelings"? These are "the markets feelings"
	that I'm trying to read. Really not "mine".

* Mon Dec 20 21:55:29 2004 rpc - I get the distinct impression that I'm supposed to be trading more
	options. Not just the big 4. Which ones? Use CBOE's table of most heavily traded.

* Tue Nov 30 13:20:17 2004 rpc - I'm working on the TWS-SqlServer vb project.
	I'm going to use the TWS Sql Server DB as the store of values. And use Excel to view the
	queries, data I'm interested in, using database queries in Excel.

* Fri Nov 26 15:46:08 2004 rpc - You can populate the tables in SQL Server by the Enterprise Manager,
	right click on a table and follow it from there. Name ranges in Excel is helpful.

* Tue Nov 23 22:13:14 2004 rpc - Developing a system that uses IB for trading the big 4 options, SPX, NDX, IWM and QQQ.
	Using the TWS database for collecting raw data via TWS.

* Thu Nov 04 13:16:09 2004 rpc - There seems to be no end to the dirty data.
	Uncovering more as I analyze just these 4 indexes. Now I'm finding bad expiration dates,
	bad prices, bad volume, and bad oi.

* Wed Nov 03 00:42:35 2004 rpc - I found a whole bunch more of dirty data. The strikes
	were not the same for the same option on different days. Over 6k rows affected out of 90k.
	This is just for the big 4. Imagine how much dirt is in the rest... The file
	CleanOptionData1.sql is the clean up for this time. 

* Mon Nov 01 12:11:01 2004 rpc - Using the big 4 below, I've created the IDXOptions tables
	to only hold options on the 4, where the option volume topped 10k at least once. This led
	to a table that contains 454 options for the year so far, of those:
	 35	IWM   
	241	QQQ   
	150	SPX   
	 28	NDX.  
 	Using SELECT count(DISTINCT [symbol]), [underlying] FROM [IDX].[dbo].[IDXOptions]
				Group By	[underlying] 

* Sun Oct 31 12:34:22 2004 rpc - I'm looking at small daily gains vs losses in the
	Big 4, QQQ, SPX, NDX, and IWM. The sheer volume of trading in these options is way beyond
	any others, actually QQQ dwarves everything else.

* Mon Oct 25 18:30:10 2004 rpc - Analyzing the data in IDX-1mil-IntraDay1.xls
	Which consists of % gains of over 100% intraday, open to close, for the indexes that have
	over 1mil volume for the year so far. Here are some observations: From data/Subtotals
		More big gains on Weds and Thurs than rest of week. Weds is by far the biggest day.
		38.99% of the big moves happened within 5 days of the next expiration. Whereas coming
		from the other way, 25 days til expir, there are less than 13%.

* Sat Oct 23 13:16:19 2004 rpc - The tradable options db (OT) needs work.
	I want only options that have large volume.

* Sat Oct 23 13:14:09 2004 rpc - I'm back in VB, Positions1 project.
	The excursion into C++ was to support Amibroker. Pursuing other paths and options.

* Fri Oct 22 10:34:40 2004 rpc - This trading is a lesson to be learned, not copied.
	Spend more time contemplating how you would build a trade yourself, not how others can do
	it for you. Use raw data and form it into meaningful positions, just like you use lumber to
	develop a structure, and use the tools that are most appropriate for the job.

* Wed Oct 20 18:13:33 2004 rpc - Having trouble with the Number format, sending to
	TWS. The example uses CSocket, and I'm using the .NET socket. So, one sends strings, the
	other sends Byte types.

* Tue Oct 19 08:34:33 2004 rpc - At 1am last night, I finally triumphed and manged to get
	Excel under control. THis required using an old "trick", using exception throwing as a
	switch.
	Now I am on th finishing the Excel interface, and interfacing to TWS.


* Mon Oct 18 22:38:57 2004 rpc - Exploring the mysteries of .NET. See
	C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET2003\SDK\v1.1\Samples\Technologies\CrossDevLanguage
	for example.

* Mon Oct 18 14:13:06 2004 rpc - I'm developing in C++, solutions \data\TradingExcel\getData2.
	Major headache with Interop assembiles, which installed from the Office 2003 disk into
	directory \windows\assembly. I need to put that in my #using dirs for project.

* Sun Oct 17 12:58:47 2004 rpc - I am creating a plugin for AmiBroker that uses both TBSP
	historical and IB tick data. AT least that is the plan. I'm using C++, because thats what
	Amibroker requires. I'm using Excel as a configuration file store, and who knows what
	else. The project is "Solution: getdata1 Project: AmiConn".

* Mon Sep 27 10:18:44 2004 rpc - I'm going to try using my big database for everything in AmiBroker (AB)
	It is less than 300meg now, so even double, it will be backupable on cd.

* Sun Sep 26 10:37:20 2004 rpc - Continuing the paring down of the OT (Options Tradable) DB list -
	I'm deleting all that have underlyings that traded at less than 15. This is 184
	underlyings, leaving 415 underlyings in the OT list. This eleiminated 587885 rows, leaving
	1508809 rows. (Of those 1,301,926 have ul close > 25). Now I'm going to eliminate unerlyings
	that don't have a certain $ volatility. This is more important than % volatility because
	option move is predicated on $ move of underlying, not % move of underlying. So, I'm
	looking for a min dolar-range of price move over some period.

	More bad data - QQQ has wrong ulclose for 4/5/04. Many have wrong data for 4/5/4. Deleting
	all records for that date. Another 8795 rows deleted. * Mon Sep 27 13:14:30 2004 rpc -
	Contacted Ike at TBSP and he found the programming error.

* Sat Sep 25 23:52:02 2004 rpc - The data has been cleaned up in the following way tyo create the
	OT db.
	1 - Find all the underlyings (ul) where OI topped 40k at least once during the year (04).
		This led to eliminating some spurious symbols from the database that don't even exist!
	2 - Put all the options for the ul from step 1 in OT. Then eliminate all the 0 volume
		rows. This actually cut the DB from 6.6 mil to 2.1 mil rows.
	Another possibility, to cut it down even more, is to eliminate all options not trading
	within a certain % range of the ul close. Have to be careful not to make this too close
	though, might consider some multiple of the ul's typical volatility as a filter.
	

* Fri Sep 24 16:56:01 2004 rpc - Have 2 databases, O and OT, O is all equity/index options,
	OT is Options Tradable, where tradable means that the underlying has had at least one
	option hit 40k OI at some point.

* Thu Sep 23 11:34:20 2004 rpc - SQL Server allows me to store a database across multiple data files
	Use Enterprise manager go to the db, properties/DataFiles and type in a new name in empty
	space. Advantage is that I can control the size so that I can archive (NOTE: after
	detaching!), onto cds. This is documented on the MSDN under "Adding and Deleting Data and
	Transaction Files in Administering Sql Server.

* Tue Sep 21 10:38:57 2004 rpc - I've signed up for a 1 week free trial to McMillan's OptionStrategist
	Lot's of fascinating information available there. VIX, PutCall ratios, probability
	calculator,,, 

* Mon Sep 20 11:11:30 2004 rpc - Have signed up for data from Tader's Access -
	http://www.tbsp.com/public/default.htm		They seem to have the best deal around, giving
	me pretty much everything, options, futures, stocks, idx, even funds, for $25 mo. The
	relevant directory locally is C:\TAW. I've created downloads there. Also got GNU unzip so
	I could unzip the zip files. Creating a format file for AmiBroker for the csv files.

	ftp://71872CHA:71872CHA@tbsp.com gets me to the data. For the long format options data go
	to ftp://tbsp.com/Quotes_Daily/daily_options_BA/ (use the
	ftp://tbsp.com/Quotes_Daily/daily_options_BA/ to get there).

	Format for options data rows is:
	symbol, date, open, high, low, close, vol, oi, bid, ask, strike, mo, call/put, expiration,
	stock, stock-close

	C:\TAW\DownLoads\2004-Options>unzip oa092004.zip -d unzipped  - sample command to unzip
	csv file	into a directory. Unzip takes wildcards.

* Sat Sep 18 11:51:19 2004 rpc - Have created AmiBroker DB using data from SQL Sever gotten froom Prophet
	There is something about the idea of the interaction of Volume and Open Interest that I
	don't understand. How can OI increase by more than the volume? 

* Wed Sep 15 16:11:07 2004 rpc - Am creating Options data SQL Server data bases
	One for each year. Using DataToSQL1 project in Visual Studio VB.

* Tue Sep 07 09:58:14 2004 rpc - I am working on an "R" system. This will measure the
	Expected Return (ER), Drawdown (Max Excursion?), and provide an entry-exit system.
	Also, a composite indicator (maybe more), are being created to act on the prime list.

* Fri Sep 03 19:49:56 2004 rpc - I have a PrimeList creation routine called
	PrimeListLarge.afl and a Secondary List creator called SecondaryList.afl.
	After the PrimeList is created, run the Secondary list routine and then entryexit routines
	agains the secondary list. PrimeList just checks for volume and price constraints, as well
	as presence of necessary bars over a range. Secondary list considers max drawdowns over
	runs of arbitrary periods. 

* Tue Aug 24 11:00:43 2004 rpc - A new idea for testing entry exits,
	Create a watchlist using some entry criteria, and then try running different exit criteria
	on that watch list. Could put the output just into the exploration window.

* Sun Aug 22 18:27:27 2004 rpc - Right now, using th ecci-emacci idea as entry-exit, and either the
	ADX or LinearRegression for short list is what I'm pursuing.

* Thu Aug 19 13:56:55 2004 rpc - In Excek, am developing an Optimization system that allows
	the optimization of individual symbols in a watchlist. I.e., each symbol can be optimized
	seperately, then a summary is published in Excel that shows the best optimized params for
	each symbol, as well as adding those params to an afl file that contains the entryexit
	code. CSVs for each file over the optimization period are stored in c:\AmibrokerOptimized
	subdirs, and the Optimization workbooks are saved in c:\data\AmibrokerOptimized
	subdirs. Optimization settings are also stored, and the afl file with the optimized params
	is stored in the directory as well. The idea is to allow for the setting of params on a
	regular basis without a whole lot of hassle. See the ABAutomation and
	ABOptimizationSheetsSummarize in Personal.xls. This is stored in c:\data\ExcelMacros. See
	notes-excel for how I made that the startup file. Next I will create a backtest system in
	Excel that works with the optimized stuff. That way I can do what is mentioned on 8/16,
	namely test over period-2.

	I need to produce a good watchlist for the entryexit code to run on.
	1 - Create a PrimeList - this has 10k vol and close between 5 and 25. This produced a list
	with 2346 stocks today.
	2 - Filter that list for using an idea out of Seykota's tribe stuff, use today is hhv over
	last 24 months. This only yielded 20 stocks!

	

* Mon Aug 16 10:40:55 2004 rpc - Developing testing procedures. Optimization patterns, etc.
	Looking at Optimizing some sysem over period-1, then testing over period 2, where period-2
   is a set of time immediately following period-1

* Thu Aug 12 22:36:09 2004 rpc - I have created scripts in data\scripts that automate creating
	Optimization reports over a list of stocks. I have created VBA code to summarize those
	reports. I have created an R^2 indicator, R-Squared2.afl, looking for a good trend
	indicator. Also constructed a simple breakout system based on system in Trend Following
	book. It didn't do as well over the 180 day test as my cci-macci1, or my
	PercentChangeRatios1, which did best of all so far. I think that linear regression as a
	tool to establish trending watchlists to run the entryexit systems against might be a good
	idea.


* Sat Aug 07 17:44:12 2004 rpc - c:\data\AmiBroker\entryexit\cci-macci1-optimizedForIndividuals.afl
	I'm going to test this code against a watch list built of stocks that have returned better
	than 30% over the last 180 days when back-tested with optimized vars.
	
* Wed Aug 04 10:56:42 2004 rpc - Analysis -
	Prerequisites -
		- Monthly chart uptrend established, Min of 5 months
		- Draw regression channel that fits trend, re adjust when necessary - this is on the
	     monthly view of chart.
		Do the same with Weekly.
		

		TEST - HDWR
		Monthly uptrend started 12/31/99, confirmed on monthly chart
		3/13/2002 - Big vol burst coming out of a penant. Great signal! Buy at 14.5. Sell
		Signal based on what? On 5/10/02 it rose to a high of 19.15. Gives 4.65 over 2 mo, or
	32%, really good! How could I have picked that off? If regression on first correction
	 on 3/28 after buying, would have taken out at 17.5 on 4/30. 20% in 1 1/2 mo.


* Mon Aug 02 07:23:27 2004 rpc - Many alerts for entry.
	VRC, IO, HOFT, NPO, ASPM, DNR, ONYX, SID,  - reset alert.

* Sun Aug 01 10:36:01 2004 rpc - Setting up practice.
	Using price/volume info from 2/1/2000 to present and seeing what my picking would result
	in, determining max possible from perfect picking and deriving my batting average.

* Sat Jul 24 10:47:14 2004 rpc - Builing lists that have recognizable patterns
	p-HorVerts - WaterFalls, or Steps, or Plateaus. These are patterns that shoot vertical, then horizontal
		repeatedly. These have well defined SR lines at the Horizontal part of the pattern.

	p-Scallops - Scalloping up. Marking these with straight lines forming angles under the
		pattern. From past observations, these are very dependable.

	p-Flag - Includes flags and pennants. The 1/2 way rule very dependable. But these do
		reverse sometimes. and head south. Definitely related to the HorVerts. HorVerts are
		repeated flags. They are also a caution of impending minor top at times. I see many
		that actually fail and fall vertically down.

	p-DescendingTriangles - Horizontal along bottom, descending from top.

	p-RoundingBottom - Will mark with 3 lines, estimating the rounding bottom.

	p-Channel - Showing channeling, does it seem like there are a lot of those down spikes, or
		pits in these? 

	p-DoubleBottom - Mark these with a line pointing at each cheek. The rule is the apex
		between cheeks needs to be 15% up, and > 3% down on second cheek (right cheek).

	p-AscendingTriangle - Horizontal top axis, ascending from bottom.

	p-SymmetricalTriangle - Both top and bottom lines are converging. Differentiating from a
	wedge is arbitrary, and can morph into a descending or ascending triangle.

	p-Wedge - Similar to the various triangles, but isn't necessarily symmetrical. Up is
	bearish, down is bullish in general.

	p-WideningTop - Flaring out at top, both on the low and high lines.

	p-Rectangles - Watch the breakouts on these.

* Tue Jul 20 10:14:46 2004 rpc - Running a Zack's screen for Z rank = 1, rank upgrade this month,
	price betweem 5-15.

* Sun Jul 18 10:02:42 2004 rpc - Builing towards a scan incrementally,
	First ran c:\data\AmiBroker\explorations\UpCandlesOver2Periods.afl, adjusting parameters
	to get a reasonable number of hits. Stopped at 109 hits, which is 5 < Close < 30, vol =
	1e6.
	Then built a "PrimeList" (watchlist) with all the stocks that met the criteia above,
	excluding the up-candle. Just volume and price constraints. Thats about 1100. The idea is
	to use that list to run the scans for buys and sells on.
	This generally sucked, and once again, I'm convinced that Amibroker is more trouble than
	its worth.

* Thu Jul 15 15:58:53 2004 rpc - Lots of information in trading journal - hard copy. Amazing how much has happend in
	the last month. I'm using Inner-Guides, and getting messages from the Bible, ala
	Gann. (Smee agin'! Gann fuck yurself!). Entering AmiBroker again. Have been using Prophet
	exclusively for charts, looking for stocks trading between 5 and 30, 10k volume min. Then
	looking for two white candle weeks. 2 week patterns for up trends, 4 week patterns for
	down. If it gets 2 red bars in a row, then sell if holding. As long as it doesn't get
	better than 2 and 2 in a 4 week period, hold off buying. Watching for channels, which seem
	to be pretty uneven, but work sometimes. Flags seem to work a lot, but also can go the
	wrong way. Downloaded the whole universe of 7700 stocks and indices using the list
	available at http://www.amibroker.com/docs/ab305.html. Going to use that to do
	screens. Seems like MSN screens are less than accurate. 

* Wed Jun 23 12:27:34 2004 rpc - Playing the PRophet scans on a pretty much day-trade (but slow) basis. (STOCKS ONLY!)
	Here is one I'm working with now.
		 Exchanges: NYSE AMEX NASDAQ(NM) 
		 Last Price is between 5 and 25 
		 Average Volume is at least 100,000 shares 
		 Bid/Ask Spread is no more than $0.10 
		 Last Price is above 200-Day MA 
		 Last Price is above 50-Day MA 
		 Last Price is above 100-Day MA 
		 P/E Ratio is no more than 40 
		 Last Price crossed above 10-Day MA 
		 Last Price is above 20-Day MA 

	Lists are growing numerous on Prophet, so putting them in the ~\Amibroker\lists directory.

	SCALLOPS - when these appear, things are moving up.
	RoundingDown - headed south.
	SpikeDown - Watch for pattern on right-side for hints. 

* Wed Mar 31 06:38:24 2004 rpc - Last few days have been hose city.
	Lost my gains of the month so far, and still losing. Market seems to be bouncing up furiously and I was still playing
	the downside. Up is pretty furious right now.

* Sat Mar 20 12:33:55 2004 rpc - Working in AmiBroker again, trying to make some sense out of the envelope
	ideas of Hurst.

* Wed Mar 17 12:51:35 2004 rpc - Recording my option trades in Excel Spreadsheets
		data\trading\InteractiveBrokersU105795.xls	and so on.
	Lessons for today:
	1 - Drawdowns trading options can be absolutely vicious. But looking back on past trades, make sure the
	timing of the exit is optimized. If there is a lot of time left and the stock is volatile (and all my underlyings are
	volatile), then hold off until you see a nicer picture.
	2 - Make sure you have some room until expiration. This keeps the pain of time decay down, and gives the stock time to
	move properly.
	3 - Check the potential moves for the stock and make sure it's reasonable to expect the number of points necessary for
	profit.
	4 - Check the time value on the option. Stay away from high premiums. (This is where selling privileges would be
	nice!)
	5 - Make sure the option volume is enough to buy or sell it easily.
	6 - Every lossing trade in Feb04 could have been a winner if held longer. I.E., bad exit. Many of them would have been
	BIG winners. (except for BAC that was not volatile enough and not nearly enough time on the option
	when I bought it), 

* Tue Mar 16 06:41:32 2004 rpc - Have been trading actively but not recording trades -
	Interactive Brokers have changed their program so that the old version of the link doesn't work. Here is the old link:

		C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\javaw.exe -Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true -jar  C:\INTERA~1\jts.jar C:\INTERA~1

	Here is the new (presently working) link:

		C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\javaw.exe -cp C:\INTERA~1\jts.jar;C:\INTERA~1\jcommon-0.9.0.jar;C:\INTERA~1\jfreechart-0.9.15.jar jclient/LoginFrame C:\INTERA~1 

	I might have to put the -Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true back in if performance is funky.

* Sat Feb 28 11:28:43 2004 rpc - Here is a new idea, derived from McMillan in Stocks And Commodities mag -
	Look for low volatility in my group of volatile stocks with high volume, and buy straddles, based on an observation of
	time frame before they swing big from their current price. 

* Tue Feb 24 04:41:01 2004 rpc - 	Confirmation of trading signals -
	I'm usually going in whole hog right off. Should open 1 and not pyramid until it does something good. Also, wait for
	more signals. Tend to run off at the suggestion of a signal. Wait for confirmation.

* Mon Feb 23 10:10:06 2004 rpc - The general mkt is in an uptrend over last many months,
	But today everything is going sideways that I'm watching. So, a sit tight time.

* Sat Feb 21 11:20:32 2004 rpc - I'm doing Post Mortems on all my trades over the last 20 days. Probably a good practice
	for the weekends. Seeing quite a few interesting artifacts!

* Wed Feb 18 22:34:30 2004 rpc - First "big plunge" day and it was a disaster.
	Lost close to 300 and down another 170 on 3k worth of trades. Discouraging.But, the fat lady didn't sing yet.

* Sat Feb 14 14:53:27 2004 rpc - Have created alerts in Prophet using channels around curent price.
	Channel hit, top or bottom, may be move coming. Noted lots of patterns like 3 up candles, next would be up trend, same
	for down candles. Notes that this is different in different time scales, but interestingly similar. So for Tues (Mon
	is holiday), have tese alerts in Market Matrix and puts in TWS. Also, reverse is new motto. 3 choices, stay in same
	direction, get out all together, go for reverse. If you see a lot of red, going south, clear, gong north. Lots of
	equality, oscillation.

* Fri Feb 13 12:38:38 2004 rpc - If my observation on 1/30 is true, I bought again on Fri and looks like I'm holding
	a put over weekend. NTES looks like it will go down, we'll see. 02/14/04 14:52 - - Nope. Went off for small profit.

	Because the whole market is feeling smelly, or is it me? I'm setting up a bunch of puts for perusal monday.

* Fri Feb 06 13:27:48 2004 rpc - Chart Patterns are evidently what I'm supposed to concentrate on,
	not Technical Indicators, or Fundamentals. OF course, both are reflected in the chart patterns. This is reminiscient
	of the drawings of the "5000 evil forces", which hardly ever got started. 

* Wed Feb 04 20:24:53 2004 rpc - Got kicked out because of day trading rule
	Seems that if you make more than 3 day trades in a 5 day period, IB won't let you buy anymore. Unless you have over
	25k in acct. This is for margin acct, if you have cash acct, restriction doesn't apply, but you only have "settled"
	equity, and that takes 3 days for stocks. Anyway, back to 5 days or less, but at least over nite! I'm being urged to
	use Prophet to the exclusion of AmiBroker. 

* Fri Jan 30 11:29:26 2004 rpc - Once thing that occured to me today, Fri may be a bad day for buying options
	because people want to get out over the weekend. On the other hand, they might be selling to get out of a short. Have
	to look at Fri option prices to get a feel for this. 02/06/04 13:26 - - Have 2 open positions in ROTH over weekend. 

* Mon Jan 26 06:29:54 2004 rpc - Indicators that need to be developed include a PSAR like indicator, that is settable to
	the date. Also a RSI or ADX type that considers volume. Also a "furthest down in x periods" indicator that shows how
	much it moved down in an x period before moving up. Give an idea of drawdown potential.

	BIG DISCOVERY regarding options. To calculate the option that will have the best return on a move, you need to look at
	Delta/Price (% rise on $1 up Price). This gives some interesting results. For instance, out of the money options may
	well have a better return potential. One thing to watch though is the spread as a portion of price. On really cheap
	options, it can be half the price (or more)!  Interestingly enough, it looks like the drawdown may be milder as
	well. This is in the near term month. Further out the return doesn't look as good. These are preliminary observations.

* Fri Jan 23 11:34:40 2004 rpc - I have created a list of the 90 stocks and indices that have an Option Volumn > 10000.
	This is in c:\data\amibroker\lists\All10000OptVol.tls. This is needed because when I start trading my whole IRA
	(currently 185k), I will need to trade many contracts on each position. That requires very liquid options. How many
	positions can I have opened at one time and track sufficiently? 10? 20? More? Less?

* Wed Jan 21 13:17:45 2004 rpc -
	Trading System has evolved. GM suggested using NYSE heavily optioned. Used Zack's to
	get list of NYSE Optionable, then Optionetics for +6000OptVol, Then filtered in
	AmiBroker for HiBeta ($5 gain-or-loss in 5 days). This gave me a list of 30. Since
	the market is in an uptrend, filtered it down to just the up 5-in-5. That yielded a
	list of 17. First 2 options on those have done really well as of today. (Way too
	early to draw any conclusions. Remember, THE MARKET CAN DO ANYTHING!;-)

	Have created 5 chart windows in AmiBroker:
		MA3 - with 3 moving averages,

		PriceChangeXPeriods -  like a momentum or RSI indicator that tracks the price change
		from X days ago,

		ADX - Wilder's ADX system,

		TrendRange - allows trend-tracking statistics, like how far "into" the trend a given
		day is, the average daily return during the trend, and the Hi-Lo range of the trend

		PSAR - Adjustable SAR for determing exits(?), maybe entries?


* Thu Jan 15 12:04:51 2004 rpc - Am starting a notes-trades for the journaling of
	actual and imagined trades. These notes will continue to be of a more general
	nature. Here is my current system development,

								*********-- Trading System --***********
		Use a list of stocks with heavily traded options (Optenetics supplies that), and
	then filter the list for stocks that have gained and/or lost at least $3 in 5 day
	periods in the recent (1 yr) time frame. If that yields too many, cull to last few
	months, etc, or more gain/loss. On an individual basis, find characteristic patterns
	that preceed the gain/loss. AmiBroker will serve to keep notes, and can put hard copy
	in chart file. Since I am looking for 5day of less pops, sell, buy back at the end of
	5 days UNLESS there is a compelling reason to extend. And if I do extend, be very,
	very careful. I can also use AmiBroker (AB), to set up indicators, as well as
	filters. I will attempt to code the patterns to generate buy and sell alerts. I will
	keep notes in Notes-trades of the actual and imagined trades. Make these as complete
	as possible.


* Thu Jan 15 06:20:33 2004 rpc - I'm going to do a bit more journaling here -
	ADTN - Looks to me like it has a recurring pattern that has a large upside gap,
	followed by a loss over the next month or so. 2 of these gaps are at 090303 and
	100303. The beginning of what I believe may be the similar pattern began on
	010604. Closed last at 34.72. Expected break down would be to 32.68, the close on
	010504. What about a short term credit spread? But then if it moves up it would nail
	me. Might be better to just buy a put. Last night I thought it had about an 80%
	chance of going down. 

* Tue Jan 13 14:02:36 2004 rpc - The search for the nefarious entry-exit signals continues...
	So far, all my explorations have been revealing in what they didn't reveal. When will
	I find signals that work?

* Fri Jan 09 21:10:36 2004 rpc - Lots done, producing charts and broken out pattern sheets,
	Left off working in Public Sub makeSummarySheet().

* Fri Jan 09 14:16:31 2004 rpc - See Cat2-3-All.xls That is where I have the data
	for CategorySystem2.afl with a 3 day look back and where the price is in 2 days. Most
	everything looks real random. But haven't checked all the patterns yet. Imagine it
	needs something more, like some sort of ma or rsi or whatever.

* Thu Jan 08 23:10:53 2004 rpc - Left off in Sub ManageCategorySystems2() in Module2
	of Personal Workbook. Copying the rows into seperate bucket sheets.

* Wed Jan 07 14:11:54 2004 rpc - Am devising "category systems" of bars.
	CategorySystem1 has only 3 categories: O>C, O=C, and C>O. Then predict the state of
	price in some n-periods after after a given "pattern of categories" have occured. The
	pattern of categories will unfold over some number of periods. For CategorySystem1,
	can start with patterns of 1-period. So there are only 3 possibilites (O>C, O=C,
	O<C). Will work in the \data\amibroker\explorations directory to build the n-period
	explorations, migrate code to indicators and entryexit when appropriate.

* Tue Jan 06 19:19:03 2004 rpc - rpcCompositePrice1.afl has an interesting idea in it
	of figuring a day index by subtracting the previous days o, l, h, c from this day's
	and adding them all together. Trading system optimized looked ok, but isn't giving me
	the number of trades I want. Want trades to have a given $ amount of return. This is
	what works with options. So looking for a system that gives me say between $3 and $10
	return in a week or two. And gives me enough of those to work. Already the constraint
	of high option volumn is built in. Am using a list built at Optionetics that just has
	stock options with daily vol for 7-149 day options > 6000, and high IV. These should
	give me the patterns I'm looking for.

* Tue Jan 06 04:12:55 2004 rpc - Continuing scan re Mon Dec 29 23:19:19 2003 -
	Am updating the list by getting the rank 10 from MSN Stock Scouter, then putting
	through Optionetics Option Ranker using a ranker that looks for min 2000 option
	volumn in 7-149 day range. This list changed considerably from Dec 29. Here is the
	technique I'm using:
	- Start up Amibroker with the list in it, run AmiQuote to update every 5 min.
	- Run the ma-crossoverForMSN-ZacksIntersection.afl scan every 5 min.
	- When a buy shows up, go to Optionetics and find a good option fit to play.
	- Sell when sell signal hit. (Have 2 open positions today, AMAT and ERTS. Only have 1
	call bought on each, for about $300 total. Starting slow!).

* Sun Jan 04 23:42:22 2004 rpc - Tomorrow, set scan that takes last 5 days range
	and creates a column for ave, and range for each. So 10 columns - then predict the
	price of the stock some days hence, given that info. (For NN). * Tue Jan 06 04:12:27
	2004 rpc -  not done yet.

* Wed Dec 31 11:40:09 2003 rpc - Generating ephemerises for Moon, Sun, Planets -
	Putting the raw form here, under notes-<body>. Then using these in Neural Net.

* Mon Dec 29 23:19:19 2003 rpc - Using a list of MSN Stock Scouter 10 ratings that
	also have over 2000 option volume a day. This list is 24 long. Finding an optimized
	trading scheme for each individually. Found scheme that batted 100% for 200 days for
	each. 
	ABX - ma-crossover1 with ma1 = 43 and ma2 =36 gives 4 winners no losers over 200
	days. smasig1 gave 10 w and 1 l but small wins.
	
* Mon Dec 29 13:57:18 2003 rpc - Trying to keep various stock lists in data\amibroker\lists
	with a bit of info at top of list about where it came from. Can chop that off in
	AmiQuote to look at history of stocks. NOTE see data\screens for old lists. Putting
	most new ones in TradingExcel.

* Wed Dec 24 12:43:46 2003 rpc - PErforming checks on Optionetics Screens using Amibroker.
	I've created a list of Zacks1-3 rank that are optionable and have beta 1 or
	greater. Then fed that to Option Ranker in Optionetics looking for good quantity in
	options vol 500 + per day for 61-90 day expires. Then use that short list, only 10
	symbols, to optimize cci-macci1.afl. Doing other stuff along these lines.

* Tue Dec 23 13:41:15 2003 rpc - Looking at Neural Net software - and cyclic info,
	yr, mo, wk, and day. 

* Sun Dec 14 22:02:34 2003 rpc - Here are the 2 best results for some entryexit strategies

	(Both over hiBetaOptionable from Zacks 1&2 list.)
	2411% FOR SMASIG1.AFL over 400 days. (til today ~).
	2253% for macd1.afl again 400 days.

	Worst they did was -50% over the whole list of Zacks1&2

	So, quite a bit of range there!
	and my optimized macd on the Zacks1and2rank-120803-Optionable-HiBeta watchlist. Beta was
	above 3.

* Sat Dec 13 22:34:13 2003 rpc - See this MFE/MAE in Ami output. Here is it's meaining.
	Maximum Favorable Excursion is what was the maximum profit that the trade had before
	the trade closed, on line number 5 you see a trade that lost 2.5 points (P&L) but
	during the time the trade was open it was one time making 1 point profit, that was
	the Maximum Favorable Excursion for that trade.

	Maximum Adverse Excursion is what was the maximum loss that the trade had before the
	trade closed, on line number 5 you see a trade that lost 2.5 points (P&L) but during
	the time the trade was open it was one time losing 5 points, that was the Maximum
	Adverse Excursion for that trade.
	*** SEE notes-amibroker for more help on result output and other stuff re ami.

* Thu Dec 11 11:59:52 2003 rpc - Putting Zacks1and2rank-120803-Optionable list in Optionetics.
	See c:\data\amibroker\lists for lists.

* Sat Dec 06 11:39:30 2003 rpc - Amibroker being used now. Building lists for backtesting
	signals. See lists in data\Amibroker\lists.

	Here are some players in the digital data stix. 	Lexar LEXR, Memored MEMXY,
	Scandisk SNDK, and SCM Microsystems and PNY Technologies.

	CandlePower is the charting name for the volume included in the width of the
	candlestick chart. N-Squared Technoloies in Salem. Gregory L. Morris, "Candlestick
	Charting Explained" is founder (?).

* Sun Nov 23 11:49:22 2003 rpc - Also, going for Optionetics Platinum.
	Let's me do options paper trades, far cheaper than doing real trades! (Until I "get
	it";-)


* Thu Nov 20 11:06:50 2003 rpc - Using the idea of letting other people do work and
	capitalizing on that, Have bought Zack's Advisor and Hulbert, as well as True
	Wealth. Optionetics looks really good, but spendy (895 yr).

* Thu Nov 13 13:37:09 2003 rpc - Once again, long interval...
	Many of my watch lists and screens were very profitable over last month, but alas, I
	wasn't in them. Looks like fnm and fre options are tanking. Using ZacksAdvisor
	now. And Sjuggered. If it is on both lists, like spf now, should probably get in on
	it. Going to sell anh and nly

* Wed Oct 01 13:53:58 2003 rpc - Here is more on exit strategy:
	Look for the option space where time-value loss ins minimal (maybe 6-3 months, or
	4-2, etc, ie. where time-value only decreases a little). Don't put a stop on the
	options, as the type being played (right at the money, or a bit out), will drop very
	far very fast. The stop is on a date-before-expiration basis. Stop out before the
	time value decreases too much, even if the option is out of the money. The upside
	exit can be determined by closeness to exit date, or other means.

* Mon Sep 15 20:47:14 2003 rpc - New charting idea -
	The ave-price * vol where vol is the volume/average-volume of the range of periods. 

* Mon Sep 15 12:44:51 2003 rpc - Clearer image of how to trade a range:
** Here are the 5 steps:
	1 - What is the projected trading range? (These are range-lines).
	2 - WHere is it now in the range?
	3 - Where should the price be in the range signaling buy put or call?  (this will be a
	line some% below the top range-line and another line some% below the bottom range
	line). Call these the signal-lines.
	4 - Establish both high and low exit prices. These will be the opposite signal-line
	than the one that triggered the buy of the put or call.
	5 - Also, establish an exit time-limit. Use the amount of time predicted to do at
	least a full cycle in the range.

** But, how to trade trends? Most of what I looked at this morning is trending up.
	Does it make sense to trade a range in a short term, say 5days, when the longer term
	is a trend? Seems like it would be safest to only trade calls in an up-trend and puts
	in a down-trend.

* Mon Sep 15 08:40:34 2003 rpc - My puts on FRE and FNM are really going titsup.
	I'm hanging in there in defiance of all reason. But, looking back at a YHOO 0104Call
	for 20, I sold it for 11. It's currently worth 15.1. I bought it for 12.4 on 8/1,
	sold for 11 on 8/4. On 8/6 it went down to a low of 10.1. So, with a 25% stop, would
	have stayed in!

* Sun Sep 14 16:26:03 2003 rpc - IGEN has a big ol gap at 7/25. IF this closes,
	nice put. Also DRYR. Accumulation of these is from 5$up in 5day list in excel. But
	DRYR took 9mo to do a partial close of its gap.

* Sat Sep 13 18:18:45 2003 rpc - Look at BGEN - maybe a put. Low volume and
	contracting price.

	Created a range table of high/low from 2000 to 9/03. Scary. PALM went from 3000-9. Up
	to 9-02-03, the last day in the db when I created it, there are a bunch of new highs
	now. Flurry of highs in 5-02 followed by flurry of lows from 7-02 to 3-03! I want to
	look at volatility over a period of x days, and see if it shows a pattern before
	runs up or down.

* Fri Sep 12 12:11:35 2003 rpc - Looking at this "repeating patterns at various resolutions"
	syndrome. IRF has one. Note the pattern after big drops in the 6th month of 01 and 02
	on 3yr daily chart. Also if gap-filling happens, it is going to shoot up to 55+. Nice
	catch there! This "double dip" shows up on todays 3d chart twice. The gap-fill is
	making me want to play this. Note * Sun Sep 14 16:54:05 2003 rpc - This is over long
	time plays - 1 to 2 yrs. Not now.

* Wed Sep 10 14:57:05 2003 rpc - Setting up trades in cash acct.
	CDE - CoerDLAne mines, stock is low priced, no options. Strong uptrend shows up in
	9mo at bottom of price channel in 3d.

	HOV - bottom PChannel on 3d and 60d, looks cautious. Inverted h&s on 9mo. Don't
	feel confident, could drop badly. leaps are expensive. * Mon Sep 15 13:11:16 2003 rpc
	-  uptrend, top of range. May be settling into a flat range. no trade.
	* Wed Sep 17 10:32:04 2003 rpc - Is a bit flat, but up2 in 3 days! Going for it.
	* Wed Oct 01 11:13:29 2003 rpc - Have a small profit right now. I'm going to cut out
	today. Waiting to see if it bips a bit more.

	INSP - Today was a down day - but cup on 9mo looks promising. Flat 3d3m last 1/2 day,
	60d shows comedown off top of PC, 40d shows 50ema as support. Almost no oi in
	options. * Mon Sep 15 13:08:18 2003 rpc - Top of range - up-trend so not a trade.

	INTC - watch trend on 9mo chart and 60d. If it hits bottom of trend, and bounces,
	buy. * Mon Sep 15 13:13:52 2003 rpc - If it holds bottom of range, will trade.

	IVX - generic drug maker. Sector 2day is second place. Other interesting in this
	sector are in watch list named generic. 1yr makes me think it's headed higher. But
	watch the 40d chart. It should stay over 50ema. * Mon Sep 15 13:30:23 2003 rpc -
	Squishy. Droped below 50ema mentioned above. Been trending up, but can't seem to
	break up above 21.

	MYL - Great uptrend, but is it run out? Looks good on all TIME frames. * Mon Sep 15
	13:34:02 2003 rpc -  Still headed north. At top of 5 day. This might be a grab and run.

	NTES - incredible upward move over last few months, but options are incredibly
	expensive. over $10 for out of money! * Mon Sep 15 13:36:30 2003 rpc - trading at 60,
	and still heading north. Both puts and calls are expensive.

	PAL - trading at 5, could easily go up 2, options thin but for large 10k of puts in
	march. Open pit mine. Try a small position. * Mon Sep 15 13:38:34 2003 rpc - This
	could be a good trade. Droped the last 3 days. But vol is thinning.

	RIMM - Big gap up on Tues. Some big vol surges, and price gap up 9/9. * Mon Sep 15
	13:41:35 2003 rpc -  Been slowly settling since 9/9.

	SINA - Watch for big pop in vol. * Mon Sep 15 13:43:06 2003 rpc - Up 2.27 today. Was
	the only really winning trade for 1 day in this list. Confusing.
	* Wed Oct 01 11:15:31 2003 rpc - Ending up buying 3 Oct calls without meaning to,
	because of confusing TW screens. Down pretty bad right now, but think it could
	recover some in the next couple of days. May have to suck eggs on this one.

* Tue Sep 09 16:05:36 2003 rpc - Am looking at charts from 72903 watch list. All
	on the list have done well. Looking at charts in terms of fractals, see a pattern in
	the large (daily, weekly) see if the patern occurs in the small, and how it did.
	Sohu has this "ugly head" pattern between 6/16 AND TOday. 

* Mon Sep 08 10:43:43 2003 rpc - Continuing the study below -
	In 2002 - 118 experienced a $10 in 10-days rise.
	Congestion dates were end of 2, middle of 7 and start of 10.

	In 2001 - 320 participated in a >$10 rise in 10 days at some time.
	Congestion dates were months 1, 4, some in 7, spread over 9and10.

	In 2000 - 625 participated in a >$10 rise in 10 days at some time.

* Sat Sep 06 06:56:42 2003 rpc - There are 2142 Unique symbols in StockDailyData
	which represents the optionable stocks. Out of those. only a 118 experienced a $10 in
	10-days rise in 2002. And 191 Had $10 down in 10 days. Looks like there are large clusters of
	downs before the main 3 clusters of rises. For 2002, the rise clusters are around
	2/28, 7/23, and 10/9. The biggest cluster of downs is around 7/9,

* Tue Sep 02 04:29:51 2003 rpc - The DB is being built with stock list that has
	bit field for each list, SP500, DJI, etc.THis is in SQLServer DB called
	StocksDailyData. Those lists can be used by the program to get the data among
	others. See DataFromWebSites VB Project.

	I hve created a bunch of stored procs in StocksDailyData SQLServer DB. Make sure the
	db gets backed up! It has to be detached to do that.

* Fri Aug 29 12:17:26 2003 rpc - FRE and FNM aregoing up, so
	my puts are faring badly. Right on the edge of throw-out.

	I'm working on analysis requirements for trading system. Need to have the base list.
** Base List -
		- Optionable, maybe the SP500 list? Simple list of optionable
	(http://www.theocc.com/onn/issues/download.jsp) is 2311 long on 8/17. (This actually
	became 2162 rows when duplicates were eliminated).  That's probably
	too broad of a field. Daily data for 10 yrs be about 2500 rows/stock, so 2500*2311
	would be 5,777,500 rows. To download S&P 500 list go to
	http://www2.standardandpoors.com/spf/xls/index/500_20030828_C.xls

	The following symbols are in the S&P500 but not the Optionable Stocks list:
	ATI BF.B LU MHS PMTC TAP.B VIA.B but most of them have options. That and the repeated
	values make me wonder about the list from OCC.

* Thu Aug 28 09:53:37 2003 rpc - Yesterday said appl flat
	Today, it went up

	Created charts of daily %change $change, and price. For SINA. 

* Tue Aug 26 09:42:47 2003 rpc - Set up a screen called 07/20/03 on Prophet
	and here are some of the behaviors since then. Why did I choose these? Screen? Need
	to record that stuff here.

	sina - went up ~9 in 9 days! came back down over next few.
	pc - very constrained - less than 1
	intc - over the 25 trading days since then, is up 2. less than 1 drawdown at worst.
	genz - little bump up over 6 sessions, then looks like a sine wave, actually lower
				right now.
	ctas - up a dollar over the period
	beas - flat
	bb	- up 3 after 11 flat days
	appl - flat
	

* Mon Aug 25 09:24:08 2003 rpc - Report of huge new home sales drove FNM and FRE up
	Also inspired JE to tell me how I was so-often (she's being kind), wrong! Oh well,


	For tomorrow - looking at Price Channel info
	sina call
	talx - look at PC-1yr chart. Note where MACD has gone. There should be support at 20.
	

* Sun Aug 24 14:44:43 2003 rpc - If my FRE and FRM positions are looking right tomorrow
	Then get out and into more lucrative options.
	.fremj -> .fremi if it trends profit.
	.fnmmm -> .fnmmk "

	mrvl - uptrend but looks like correction to 34 first is possible. So may be a put
	looks like it could fill down to 38 easy. The calls look not to inviting, not that
	much upside?

	Look at nice uptrend in genz all dates.

	SPF and other building could move up.

	Need to find more up because mkt is up and looks like it will cont for while.

	Others to check: expand the virt banks? HighOctaneBig1WeekChange screen. esp. sndk.


* Sat Aug 23 10:58:44 2003 rpc - One of the Elliott news - ops was about
	FRE and FNM, saying that the big media was predicting gloom for them big time.

	China Petro Chem (SNP) looks like a good up-trade. No options though.

* Wed Aug 20 12:47:20 2003 rpc - Today seems to be a good day. My put options on
	FNM and FRE are moving the right way and RWAV is up. Looks like China might be
	getting ready to peel out. Staples may be a bull play and HP a bear.

* Mon Aug 18 20:35:04 2003 rpc - The idea of events seems very useful. Define a
	set of events to check for? Historical testing of this could be pretty difficult.

* Sun Aug 17 19:40:33 2003 rpc - I need to ask questions about the relationships
	between the % change in a stock over some number of periods after say an economic
	indicator announcement. First want to look at the reaction of the DJX and SPX for
	overall market trend. Then the reaction of the stock. Like up when the indicator is
	up, and down when the indicator is down. And...

* Sun Aug 17 12:15:34 2003 rpc - Screens for 1 day Price increase:
	These are all from the http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/finder/customstocks.asp#Big
	For 1 day 1%	2032
	For 1 day 2%	1249
	For 1 day 3%	 916
	For 1 day 5%	 573
	For 1 day 10%	 321
	For 1 day 20%	 156
	The highest overall was KMart emerging from bankruptcy with + 19000% gain in stock
	price. Then at 50 highest down to a measly 50% price increase in one day. When the
	further restraint of stock price over 30$ is added, then the highest percent change
	is 14.17%. So if you're going to get the liquidity of $30 stocks, sacrifice the
	really big 1 day gains. There were only 3 over 5% 1 day gain with stock price >=30. 
* Thu Aug 14 07:44:49 2003 rpc - Place called blackbox uses 5 tech indicators to rate stocks.
	They are at http://www.blackboxinvesting.com/default.asp The 5 indicators are:
		Stochastic Oscillator, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ADX, On Balance Volume

	I'm reading an e-book, High Octane Investing pdf in zips. Options focused. Trading
	seems hopeless right now.
	Some points from the book:
** Don't trade 1st 1/2 hr. Price
	direction for day is often set by 10pm. Charts confirmed this at quick look today,
	where it seemed that if a stock had risen at next tick after 10am (1/2 hr after open
	at 9:30) then it would be up for the day. And vice-versa. Should probably get a bunch
	of data downloaded and test this hypothesis. He actually suggests waiting 1 hr til
	10:30.
** Look at the range of price over some reasonable time frame to see what kind of move
	you can reasonably expect for a given stock. Like look over a yrs worth of daily
	moves to determine an average daily move. And a range of moves with probabilites.

** OCO (One cancels all) orders are "bracket" ordrs in TWS. Bracket lets you set
		LiMiT to take PROFIT  and SToP to control loss. You could set profit/loss exits
	with Conditional Orders. Here you could use the price of the underlying as a sell
	signal. Or something else that was relevant to what is being traded.
** This guy looks at Sectors on Sat. Morn. (and every nite!) Looks for
	accumulation / distribution. Can use sector info for setting stops and
	triggers.
** Tight bid/ask spreads, usually max .10, sometimes accepts up to .20.
** Funels from 150 down to 12 stocks.

	


	FRE Put -
** I'm holding this below my 2$ trail. Am I crazy? I think it is going to eventually
	dive, based on the 10$ dive it took on 6/9 on very heavy volume. One piece of really
	bad news - bye bye.
** It closed at a 212 loss, 12 below my former stop. Looking at the chart for FRE
	It seems to me that it could go to 59 and it is trading at 50 right now. That would
	wipe out my option. Unless something wierd happens tomorrow, I'm bailing.

	FNM Put -
** This looks better. Like it might not go any higher than 63.5 based on trendlines on
	40 day, 30min interval chart. It's trading at 62.77, so that's only a .75 rise. 


* Wed Aug 13 11:25:03 2003 rpc - FNM and FRE have been climbing, but stills seems to me they
	are coming down before year end.

* Thu Aug 07 15:42:20 2003 rpc - Have decided that building my own system is the only hope,
	So working on it.

* Sat Aug 02 17:02:44 2003 rpc - Getting excited about Fanny and Freddie. Looks to me
	like they've begun a dive (FNM down last 3 weeks week to week, mo-mo last 4 mo, only
	up 2 of the last 15 days). Bonds and interest rates - because the mortgage loans are
	set by bond rates. and bond rates have been rising despite fed cuts. But there is
	heavy put volume, the p/c is 1.07 (see tradingdata\fnm-options080203.xls). Very
	little insider selling, only 2% short interest. Hows the specialist going to behave?
	FRE on the other hand has a much lower p/c of 0.693303031 1.2% short-interest, no
	insider trading. What to put in TWS when it comes back up:

	FNM .LFNMM FRE .FREMK



* Tue Jul 29 10:46:42 2003 rpc - Adding China watchlist to Prophet.
	Just space delimited list for multiple symbols.

	Created a Canslim1 filter for MSN Stock Screener. Really an interesting list it
	returned. I can get quite a bit of my screener stuff in there, so slecting down from
	there is what needs to be further screened. 

* Mon Jul 28 15:38:50 2003 rpc - Looking at sector funds and sector-fund options. Amex
	has a lot of these. Select Sector SPDR Funds is what they are called. See
	http://www.amex.com/?href=http://www.amex.com/options/prodInf/OptPiIndex.jsp
	They don't have much option play in general.

* Tue Jul 22 14:22:00 2003 rpc - AAPL looks hot coming into tomorrow.	

* Tue Jul 22 10:06:36 2003 rpc - To break down the extra dimension (math)
** 		1 - Inputs are selections.
***			.1 - Based on some specific screen. The screen is pretty generic, can be "I heard it on the wind", but document it
**			2 - Outputs are limit and stop prices.

	Above is using the xemacs  outline-mode.

	In regards to 1.1 above, the generic top level screens have their own directory -
	\data\screens. Right now all the screens were entered using excel. The screens are
	structured like funnels, top level is loose screen, middle is a tighter collection of
	constraints - and lastly are my victims. Actually going to set this up in one
	sheet. See sheets.xlt in \data\Office Templates.

* Tue Jul 22 06:50:18 2003 rpc - ACH is another china play. Aluminum Co of China.
	Chinese plays:
	ACH SOHU CHINA

* Mon Jul 14 08:28:47 2003 rpc - USG could go up based on new Asbestos law,
	which lets it off th ehook for all kinds of litigation. Currently weak at 15.3 in
	downtrend.

	PEP LONG 7/10 Agile Trader.	

	CC is possible call.
	Playing the Chinese SOHU - chinese internet portal. Anyhting from china...

* Wed Jul 09 16:38:59 2003 rpc - Looks to me like Fannie and Freddie will be good puts
	when s-h-t-f. Financials are funny. FNM and FRE

	Check FLEX re agile trader tech anal.

	Short AOL - big stock holder suit and again reflated. If the mkt turns down, do a
	screen on ultrahigh PEs.

* Wed Jul 09 06:06:47 2003 rpc - Went and looked at the Baba1 screen - mostly slight gains.
	Am checking the performance of the options for the time frame. This is 1.5 weeks
	later. (June30 was initiation of screen.) We are into earnings season. So far AA has
	reported and bipped up a bit. Seems to be a strong bull right now.


* Mon Jul 07 07:49:17 2003 rpc - Mkt is still perking up. The Baba1 screen hasn't done well
	at least as far as I've watched it. Thinking about using index trading so I can be
	more focused. Trying to do the realm of stocks seems overwhelming. Too many of
	them. Downloaded mysql to set up a database for option and stock prices to do
	analysis in. See c:\mysql.

* Mon Jun 30 10:24:27 2003 rpc - Have my 1st screen Baba1 up and running, also
	have other active research going on, using QT and 21st Century newsletters a
	lot. Mkt. looks like it could be heading south today.

* Thu Jun 26 07:15:17 2003 rpc - http://stockcharts.com/charts/ has great charts.
	http://stockcharts.com/candleglance?nxtl,sebl,pdx,eem,nem,nly,anh,thc,slm,ign|B|B14#custom
	is a good example.

* Wed Jun 25 07:31:37 2003 rpc - Opened to sell SEBL puts at 2.65 and buy NXTL call.
	Got 1 NXTL Nov15C at 3.90.

* Wed Jun 25 06:49:49 2003 rpc - The strategy of buying puts when lots of calls
	was contra-indicated by tracking. See
	C:\data\TradingData\PositionTracking1-Criteria1.xls.

* Tue Jun 24 13:52:57 2003 rpc - THC tanking big time. SLM (Sallie Mae) heading thru the roof.
	SLM is a good short time Call. THC looks like a put.

* Tue Jun 24 13:30:08 2003 rpc - NXTL - looks like a call play. Chart looks like it is on
	leg 3 of an e-wave up starting in July of 02. But could be done with w3 and on to w4
	correction, which could bring it down to 8.5 fro 16.45 today.

* Tue Jun 24 11:23:36 2003 rpc - Track PDX puts - this ->
Pediatrix Notified of Billing Inquiry ( )
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Jun 24, 2003 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc.,
	(NYSE:PDX) today announced that it has been advised by a U.S. Attorney's Office that it is

	information request, informally or by subpoena, within the next few weeks. Pediatrix
	intends to cooperate fully with this investigation.



* Tue Jun 24 09:38:14 2003 rpc - Found the password to the 2001 Optiond Data file using
	a zip password busting tool in ZipPasswordBreaker-AZPR called azpr.exe. The password
	is "secret". Got it from http://www.elcomsoft.com/azpr.html,

* Mon Jun 23 06:35:06 2003 rpc - I'm cancelling Against he Crowd, Prophet Gold, and keeping
	Prophet FTP-Options, the CBOE/Moneynet service at 

* Sun Jun 22 08:24:26 2003 rpc - Option Symbols are constructed of
		Root symbol + Month code + Strike price code
	I have these in \data\TradingSystem,xls

* Thu Jun 19 07:09:28 2003 rpc - Joined Schaeffer's Research site. He has a monthly letter with
	10 recommendations. Pretty disappointed in Prophet Gold. Their screens are half
	baked, as is most of their site. The "half baked" theme runs through all of their
	stuff. Sujerrud has bombed on the only 2 recmds. for the month so far. Will ask for
	my money back.

* Wed Jun 18 07:18:53 2003 rpc - This is a list of data sites, most futures, from TWS newsgroup:
	Here is my usual list of tick data suppliers :

* Mon Jun 16 06:40:41 2003 rpc - The Options Data I get from Prophet needs to be parsed
	and made usable. ftp://RICKCHARON@ftp.prophetinfo.com/SOptions/ in a borwser gets me
	there, and makes downloading easy. Format of the data files is:
		symbol, open, high, low, close, volume, open interest 	

* Sun Jun 15 10:14:02 2003 rpc - The idea of comlexity in trading systems, different levels.
	1st order technical might be RSI croses below to above 30, buy and sell when RSI moves
	from above 70 to below 70. A 2nd order trading system would use rules for deciding on
	the number of periods to use to calculate the RSI. A 3rd order system would consist
	of rules for categorizing markets based on trendiness and volatility. Etc.

* Sat Jun 14 14:51:38 2003 rpc - Here is a new design for TradingDesk -
	Entry/Exit screens - Entry based on the funnel idea of sales. Exit lists each open
	position with exit criteria and resluting price. 

* Sat Jun 14 14:49:44 2003 rpc - IDBE is the company Porter Stansberry is pushing,
	Ibelieve. 

* Thu Jun 05 05:45:28 2003 rpc - Not using AmiBroker at all, or Message Queueing,
	And am changing all the OleDBDataAdapters to use "last in wins" instead of optimistic
	locking. Much simpler and avoids a bunch of spurious errors.

* Thu May 08 06:00:24 2003 rpc - Options naming conventions...
	this is from http://biz.yahoo.com/opt/symbol.html
	The basic parts of an option symbol are: Root symbol + Month code + Strike price code

* Thu Apr 24 07:18:49 2003 rpc - communication between programs has become a critical
	element. So, installing the Message Queuing SDK from msdn site
	http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/  Getting at the
	service is via Computer Management Console. select "Message Queuing" and F1 gets help
	page. (as of * Thu Jun 05 05:44:42 2003 rpc - not using)

* Fri Apr 11 06:01:05 2003 rpc - Am developiong my entry-exit rules
	Using Amibroker. First one utilizes CCI. See data\Amibroker\entryexit\cci-macci1.afl.

	Am starting a notes-technicalanalysis to keep track of stuff I learn about the topic.

* Tue Apr 08 11:13:51 2003 rpc - Here is a way to get a list of all optionable stocks:
	Go to http://www.theocc.com/onn/issues/download.jsp - this is the Options Clearing
	Coproration. Select "All" in the top list, "Underlying Symbol" in the bottom. This
	service needs to be explored, lots more available there.

* Sat Mar 15 05:32:35 2003 rpc - BioPharm play Porter Stansbury
	After VXGN, little leary, but IDBE looks interesting. See article about the Plague.

* Fri Mar 14 05:37:54 2003 rpc - VXGN is up 47% in last 2 days.
	Has a presentation in Boston March 19. Putting it on watch list.
	Rise is attributed to earnings higher.


* Thu Mar 13 12:47:39 2003 rpc - Looking for a web service to get quotes, not
	available through IB. http://www.webservicex.net/stockquote.asmx
	gets good info, last trade time, and PE, earnings if available. They also have a
	send-fax service!

	ICPHX is a fund that does foreign currencies. Looks good. Steady up in this climate.

* Wed Mar 12 22:55:37 2003 rpc - Possible plays...
	MSD, FAX, VXGN (this last is a biggie long shot, but worth watching.) * Thu Jun 24
	17:50:43 2004 rpc - Now VXGNE

* Tue Mar 11 16:58:24 2003 rpc - QuoteTracker is useful. There is a
	notes-quotetracker

* Thu Mar 06 00:45:15 2003 rpc - Van Tharps trading game intro -
	Is here, under notes-vantharp.

* Sat Mar 01 00:21:57 2003 rpc - Buy rcmd from Pirate Steve, MSD -
	Foreign bond fund, says it is discounted and at the bottom, no where to go but up.

* Mon Feb 24 18:28:12 2003 rpc - Looks like VXGN may be a hot play -
	This from Porter Stansberry. Aids vaccine, bad press, but he says it is rockin. Thing
	bombed today when he thought it would zoom. Still might be worth watching.

	Looking at 5% increase in one day, added a few other criteria, like >$2 share,
	net-profit margin >= 0, net insider transcactions >=0, and on NASDAQ. Interesting is
	BDMS, a dental group chain that is got a lot of purchases by insiders, no sales, and
	some recent. Also, it's price has increased by 30% in less than a month, with a
	steady line up. closed at 12.7 today.	

* Sat Feb 22 12:44:20 2003 rpc - Regarding Strategies and Positions	---
	A trailing stop is a trigger, not a strategy. It would ce cool if I could store code
	in the trigger field, or at least a code template.

	When you create a position, it should automatically create the transactions (create
	the records, not execute the transactions), that reify that position. The
	transactions created will directly correspond to the StrategyTransactions that are
	linked to the Strategy that this position is an instance of.

* Thu Feb 20 22:48:50 2003 rpc - See notes-vb for info about tlbimp for Amibroker
	* Sun Mar 16 13:53:51 2003 rpc - Above is a lie. I never created a notes-vb.
	Have created a working reference to Amibroker in a VB project,
	c:\data\tradingVB\Windows Application2. Also have reference to Traders Workstation in
	same project. Need to get my transactions into the Acces Positions DB and get the
	interface to it built.

* Tue Feb 18 13:13:09 2003 rpc - Bought ANH, NLY and VIPSX. anh and nly are
	mortagage virt. banks, both have 25% stops on them. VIPSX is Vanguard inflation hedge
	fund, bought 2500$, not shares.

	Created GenericDrug watch on rcmmd of change wave. Says TEVA will dip on war break
	out because it's offices are in Isreal, but will rise after.

* Sun Feb 16 23:21:17 2003 rpc - Dr. Steve rcmmd's
	Evergreen bank CDs in foreign currencies to protect against falling dollar. Diligence
	is another Pirate Investor and rcmmd's some biotechs, whichare in a watchlist in Amibroker.

* Wed Feb 12 20:35:15 2003 rpc - Reading an article that talks about combining RSI (for Strength),
	Stochastic Indicator (for momentuum), and MACD for Trend. By combining these 3 says
	he can really go 3x in weeks. This is the MST trader alert at
	http://www.agora-inc.com/reports/MST/FastWealth/ 

* Wed Feb 12 20:29:59 2003 rpc - Bought 100FCX_PC@36.40. This is a gold play.
	Gold is getting a lot of positive momentuum in the press and from pirate investor and
	others. recmded are NEM and AU. RGLD has an outrageous chart, it gained 5x this year.

* Fri Feb 07 12:37:54 2003 rpc - Bought 300 DSU confirmation number is 1008746694 at Brown.
	- DSU 300@5.72 StopLoss at 4.50.hh

* Thu Feb 06 23:33:20 2003 rpc - Probably going to buy Anworth Mortgage Asset Corporation
	To be puchased -
		- ANH current div 16%. NLY 15.8%. These are mortgage funds "virtual banks".
		- a bear fund. BEARX, URPIX, This is from PirateInvestor, but tracks my own
			feelings.
		- He mentions the dollar being weak, and using Aussie based FAX as play there.
		- Gold redeemable preferred - FCX_PC or FCXPRC
		- DSU - high yield bond fund.
		



	My feeling is that this is the big bear trend, and I don't really want to buck it,
	though occassionally I see interesting up stocks. They are anomolies and not to be trusted.

* Mon Jan 27 18:31:11 2003 rpc - The bear seems to be getting ready to really roar.
	URPIX is an ETF that is inverse 200% to SP500. Might be a good play. BEARX is
	another. 

* Fri Jan 17 22:40:56 2003 rpc - Gann suggests playing what is really active.
	For now, thats bios, pharms, internet, and ? PFE RX are medical plays that are really
	active. AOL is really active. SRDX health instruments, EBAY, GPRO genprobe!

	 Gann emphasizes looking at various time charts, month, quarter, day, week, to get a
	sense of say the "environment" of a daily chart - i.e., it's bigger picture.

	Set up a sheet of indexes - See barchart.com  - and what about ZVZZT, and

* Thu Jan 16 00:19:53 2003 rpc - After the end of gainful employment, at the
	beginning of the trader's life...
	Have bought AmiBroker. Will be creating .tls files for various watches. Will put
	these in data\amibroker\*.tls


* Mon Jan 06 01:20:55 2003 rpc - Looking for a trading platform,
	InteractiveBrokers has a link to TradingSolutions $1000 which uses neural nets and tech
	indicators. The other fascinating one is TradeStation 50$mo.. Talks a lot about
	strategies.
	Amibroker is the cheapest, and from the sounds of it may be good Charting/Analysis
	prog. Then there is Wealth-Lab.

* Sun Nov 24 22:58:16 2002 rpc - Elliott Wave Theory in a nutshell by Steve Hochberg
	Interestingly, despite the variance in expression of each pattern, there are still
	just three basic rules to the Wave Principle. Wave 2 cannot retrace more than 100% of
	wave 1; wave 4 cannot end in the price territory of wave 1; and of waves 1, 3 and 5,
	wave 3 can never be the shortest. If you follow these three simple rules in a
	disciplined manner, then much of the subjectivity of Elliott is removed and you
	have a completely objective way to measure market moves.





* Tue Nov 19 11:47:50 2002 rpc - Create "qualifiers" for strategies.
	This is the meat. 

* Thu Oct 24 11:05:34 2002 rpc - Looking at spreads on IBM in particular.
	Seems like a strategy that would work in a market that you know is going to move, but
	aren't too sure which way. Going to book the values in the db. Look at
	d:\data\tradingIBJava\getData\DoOptionData1.java which is saving data. See more notes
	in d:\data\tradingIBJava\notes-tradingIBJAva.

* Wed Oct 02 04:37:00 2002 rpc - Hunting for likely plays and positions -
	Check out MMM - Schaefer thinks it will go down significantly sometime in future. See
	http://www.options-iri.com/schaeffer/bernie_observations.asp?ID=6185 seems strong
	right now.

* Fri Sep 27 22:06:00 2002 rpc - See d:\data\tradingIBJava\notes-tradingIBJava
	This is where it's happening now.

* Wed Aug 15 17:37:28 2001 rpc - See notes-stockresearch as well
	See "Creating the nwind Virtual Directory" in SQL Server help. Idea is to make
	database http accessible.

* Sat Mar 31 05:56:25 2001 rpc - Parsing the html seems to be the recurring theme here. I
	need to find the most advantageuos way to do this. Typing in the dark is a way to
	learn the keyboard. What about Xemacs as a way to learn html<M>???	

* WED Mar 28 19:16:16 2001 rpc - Have been exploring Access. It's possibilites seem pretty
	unique, being able to pull stuff and parse, using VB, then populate the DB directly.

* Wed Feb 07 14:41:57 2001 rpc - d:\data\VB-projects\WebScraper2 is project that I worked
	on in Baja. Have it parsing the hilo files, and putting results in datafile. Need to
	remove percent sign in d:\data\VB-projects\WebScraper2\RowsTest.out.	


* Mon Jan 15 19:39:06 2001 rpc - In Cabo, have spent the week getting
	into SQL-Server and VB. ADO seems to be the best bet for access, as
	it gives access to many other data sources, not just
	Relational. For Web Projects see Visual InterDev. JScript looks
	like an interesting technology for scripting web pages. A working
	VB/SQL Server  project is in
	D:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\80\Tools\DevTools\Samples\ado\vb\employee.
