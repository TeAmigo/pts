PTSCharts Keyboard and Mouse Key Actions (bindings)

* CHECK - <2014-05-12 Mon 13:11><2014-04-03 Thu 16:49> All but the Right Mouse is handled in /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptscharts/src/main/java/ptscharts/PtsMouseKeyboardController.java - 


* Right Mouse Click opens up a context menu, /share/JavaDev/teamigo/ptscharts/src/main/java/ptscharts/PtsChartPanel.java function extendPopupMenu() is where they get added. It is an extension to the jFreeChart ChartPanel. The actionPerformed() function in PtsChartPanel does the deed.

***** a - restore Auto Bounds (pts space at both left and right side, shows all)
